McCANN COMPANY1920THE JAMES A. McCANN COMPANYPRINTED IN THE U.S.A.INTRODUCTIONThe medical profession is justly conservative. Human life should not beconsidered as the proper material for wild experiments.Conservatism, however, is too often a welcome excuse for lazy minds,loath to adapt themselves to fast changing conditions.Remember the scornful reception which first was accorded to Freud\\'sdiscoveries in the domain of the unconscious.When after years of patient observations, he finally decided to appearbefore medical bodies to tell them modestly of some facts which alwaysrecurred in his dream and his patients\\' dreams, he was first laughed atand then avoided as a crank.The words \"dream interpretation\" were and still are indeed fraught withunpleasant, unscientific associations. They remind one of all sorts ofchildish, superstitious notions, which make up the thread and woof ofdream books, read by none but the ignorant and the primitive.The wealth of detail, the infinite care never to let anything passunexplained, with which he presented to the public the result of hisinvestigations, are impressing more and more serious-minded scientists,but the examination of his evidential data demands arduous work andpresupposes an absolutely open mind.This is why we still encounter men, totally unfamiliar with Freud\\'swritings, men who were not even interested enough in the subject toattempt an interpretation of their dreams or their patients\\' dreams,deriding Freud\\'s theories and combatting them with the help ofstatements which he never made.Some of them, like Professor Boris Sidis, reach at times conclusionswhich are strangely similar to Freud\\'s, but in their ignorance ofpsychoanalytic literature, they fail to credit Freud for observationsantedating theirs.Besides those who sneer at dream study, because they have never lookedinto the subject, there are those who do not dare to face the factsrevealed by dream study. Dreams tell us many an unpleasant biologicaltruth about ourselves and only very free minds can thrive on such adiet. Self-deception is a plant which withers fast in the pellucidatmosphere of dream investigation.The weakling and the neurotic attached to his neurosis are not anxiousto turn such a powerful searchlight upon the dark corners of theirpsychology.Freud\\'s theories are anything but theoretical.He was moved by the fact that there always seemed to be a closeconnection between his patients\\' dreams and their mental abnormalities,to collect thousands of dreams and to compare them with the casehistories in his possession.He did not start out with a preconceived bias, hoping to find evidencewhich might support his views. He looked at facts a thousand times\"until they began to tell him something.\"His attitude toward dream study was, in other words, that of astatistician who does not know, and has no means of foreseeing, whatconclusions will be forced on him by the information he is gathering,but who is fully prepared to accept those unavoidable conclusions.This was indeed a novel way in psychology. Psychologists had always beenwont to build, in what Bleuler calls \"autistic ways,\" that is throughmethods in no wise supported by evidence, some attractive hypothesis,which sprung from their brain, like Minerva from Jove\\'s brain, fullyarmed.After which, they would stretch upon that unyielding frame the hide of areality which they had previously killed.It is only to minds suffering from the same distortions, to minds alsoautistically inclined, that those empty, artificial structures appearacceptable molds for philosophic thinking.The pragmatic view that \"truth is what works\" had not been as yetexpressed when Freud published his revolutionary views on the psychologyof dreams.Five facts of first magnitude were made obvious to the world by hisinterpretation of dreams.First of all, Freud pointed out a constant connection between some partof every dream and some detail of the dreamer\\'s life during the previouswaking state. This positively establishes a relation between sleepingstates and waking states and disposes of the widely prevalent view thatdreams are purely nonsensical phenomena coming from nowhere and leadingnowhere.Secondly, Freud, after studying the dreamer\\'s life and modes of thought,after noting down all his mannerisms and the apparently insignificantdetails of his conduct which reveal his secret thoughts, came to theconclusion that there was in every dream the attempted or successfulgratification of some wish, conscious or unconscious.Thirdly, he proved that many of our dream visions are symbolical, whichcauses us to consider them as absurd and unintelligible; theuniversality of those symbols, however, makes them very transparent tothe trained observer.Fourthly, Freud showed that sexual desires play an enormous part in ourunconscious, a part which puritanical hypocrisy has always tried tominimize, if not to ignore entirely.Finally, Freud established a direct connection between dreams andinsanity, between the symbolic visions of our sleep and the symbolicactions of the mentally deranged.There were, of course, many other observations which Freud made whiledissecting the dreams of his patients, but not all of them present asmuch interest as the foregoing nor were they as revolutionary or likelyto wield as much influence on modern psychiatry.Other explorers have struck the path blazed by Freud and leading intoman\\'s unconscious. Jung of Zurich, Adler of Vienna and Kempf ofWashington, D.C., have made to the study of the unconscious,contributions which have brought that study into fields which Freudhimself never dreamt of invading.One fact which cannot be too emphatically stated, however, is that butfor Freud\\'s wishfulfillment theory of dreams, neither Jung\\'s \"energictheory,\" nor Adler\\'s theory of \"organ inferiority and compensation,\"nor Kempf\\'s \"dynamic mechanism\" might have been formulated.Freud is the father of modern abnormal psychology and he established thepsychoanalytical point of view. No one who is not well grounded inFreudian lore can hope to achieve any work of value in the field ofpsychoanalysis.On the other hand, let no one repeat the absurd assertion that Freudismis a sort of religion bounded with dogmas and requiring an act of faith.Freudism as such was merely a stage in the development ofpsychoanalysis, a stage out of which all but a few bigoted campfollowers, totally lacking in originality, have evolved. Thousands ofstones have been added to the structure erected by the Viennesephysician and many more will be added in the course of time.But the new additions to that structure would collapse like a house ofcards but for the original foundations which are as indestructible asHarvey\\'s statement as to the circulation of the blood.Regardless of whatever additions or changes have been made to theoriginal structure, the analytic point of view remains unchanged.That point of view is not only revolutionising all the methods ofdiagnosis and treatment of mental derangements, but compelling theintelligent, up-to-date physician to revise entirely his attitude toalmost every kind of disease.The insane are no longer absurd and pitiable people, to be herded inasylums till nature either cures them or relieves them, through death,of their misery. The insane who have not been made so by actual injuryto their brain or nervous system, are the victims of unconscious forceswhich cause them to do abnormally things which they might be helped todo normally.Insight into one\\'s psychology is replacing victoriously sedatives andrest cures.Physicians dealing with \"purely\" physical cases have begun to take intoserious consideration the \"mental\" factors which have predisposed apatient to certain ailments.Freud\\'s views have also made a revision of all ethical and social valuesunavoidable and have thrown an unexpected flood of light upon literaryand artistic accomplishment.But the Freudian point of view, or more broadly speaking, thepsychoanalytic point of view, shall ever remain a puzzle to those who,from laziness or indifference, refuse to survey with the great Viennesethe field over which he carefully groped his way. We shall never beconvinced until we repeat under his guidance all his laboratoryexperiments.We must follow him through the thickets of the unconscious, through theland which had never been charted because academic philosophers,following the line of least effort, had decided _a priori_ that it couldnot be charted.Ancient geographers, when exhausting their store of information aboutdistant lands, yielded to an unscientific craving for romance and,without any evidence to support their day dreams, filled the blankspaces left on their maps by unexplored tracts with amusing inserts suchas \"Here there are lions.\"Thanks to Freud\\'s interpretation of dreams the \"royal road\" into theunconscious is now open to all explorers. They shall not find lions,they shall find man himself, and the record of all his life and of hisstruggle with reality.And it is only after seeing man as his unconscious, revealed by hisdreams, presents him to us that we shall understand him fully. For asFreud said to Putnam: \"We are what we are because we have been what wehave been.\"Not a few serious-minded students, however, have been discouraged fromattempting a study of Freud\\'s dream psychology.The book in which he originally offered to the world his interpretationof dreams was as circumstantial as a legal record to be pondered over byscientists at their leisure, not to be assimilated in a few hours bythe average alert reader. In those days, Freud could not leave out anydetail likely to make his extremely novel thesis evidentially acceptableto those willing to sift data.Freud himself, however, realized the magnitude of the task which thereading of his _magnum opus_ imposed upon those who have not beenprepared for it by long psychological and scientific training and heabstracted from that gigantic work the parts which constitute theessential of his discoveries.The publishers of the present book deserve credit for presenting to thereading public the gist of Freud\\'s psychology in the master\\'s own words,and in a form which shall neither discourage beginners, nor appear tooelementary to those who are more advanced in psychoanalytic study.Dream psychology is the key to Freud\\'s works and to all modernpsychology. With a simple, compact manual such as _Dream Psychology_there shall be no longer any excuse for ignorance of the mostrevolutionary psychological system of modern times.ANDRÃ‰ TRIDON.  121 Madison Avenue, New York.

When they were recalled afterawakening they were regarded as either the friendly or hostilemanifestation of some higher powers, demoniacal and Divine. With therise of scientific thought the whole of this expressive mythology wastransferred to psychology; to-day there is but a small minority amongeducated persons who doubt that the dream is the dreamer\\'s own psychicalact.But since the downfall of the mythological hypothesis an interpretationof the dream has been wanting. The conditions of its origin; itsrelationship to our psychical life when we are awake; its independenceof disturbances which, during the state of sleep, seem to compel notice;its many peculiarities repugnant to our waking thought; the incongruencebetween its images and the feelings they engender; then the dream\\'sevanescence, the way in which, on awakening, our thoughts thrust itaside as something bizarre, and our reminiscences mutilating orrejecting it--all these and many other problems have for many hundredyears demanded answers which up till now could never have beensatisfactory. Before all there is the question as to the meaning of thedream, a question which is in itself double-sided. There is, firstly,the psychical significance of the dream, its position with regard to thepsychical processes, as to a possible biological function; secondly, hasthe dream a meaning--can sense be made of each single dream as of othermental syntheses?Three tendencies can be observed in the estimation of dreams. Manyphilosophers have given currency to one of these tendencies, one whichat the same time preserves something of the dream\\'s formerover-valuation. The foundation of dream life is for them a peculiarstate of psychical activity, which they even celebrate as elevation tosome higher state. Schubert, for instance, claims: \"The dream is theliberation of the spirit from the pressure of external nature, adetachment of the soul from the fetters of matter.\" Not all go so far asthis, but many maintain that dreams have their origin in real spiritualexcitations, and are the outward manifestations of spiritual powerswhose free movements have been hampered during the day (\"DreamPhantasies,\" Scherner, Volkelt). A large number of observers acknowledgethat dream life is capable of extraordinary achievements--at any rate,in certain fields (\"Memory\").In striking contradiction with this the majority of medical writershardly admit that the dream is a psychical phenomenon at all. Accordingto them dreams are provoked and initiated exclusively by stimuliproceeding from the senses or the body, which either reach the sleeperfrom without or are accidental disturbances of his internal organs. Thedream has no greater claim to meaning and importance than the soundcalled forth by the ten fingers of a person quite unacquainted withmusic running his fingers over the keys of an instrument. The dream isto be regarded, says Binz, \"as a physical process always useless,frequently morbid.\" All the peculiarities of dream life are explicableas the incoherent effort, due to some physiological stimulus, of certainorgans, or of the cortical elements of a brain otherwise asleep.But slightly affected by scientific opinion and untroubled as to theorigin of dreams, the popular view holds firmly to the belief thatdreams really have got a meaning, in some way they do foretell thefuture, whilst the meaning can be unravelled in some way or other fromits oft bizarre and enigmatical content. The reading of dreams consistsin replacing the events of the dream, so far as remembered, by otherevents. This is done either scene by scene, _according to some rigidkey_, or the dream as a whole is replaced by something else of which itwas a _symbol_. Serious-minded persons laugh at these efforts--\"Dreamsare but sea-foam!\"One day I discovered to my amazement that the popular view grounded insuperstition, and not the medical one, comes nearer to the truth aboutdreams. I arrived at new conclusions about dreams by the use of a newmethod of psychological investigation, one which had rendered me goodservice in the investigation of phobias, obsessions, illusions, and thelike, and which, under the name \"psycho-analysis,\" had found acceptanceby a whole school of investigators. The manifold analogies of dream lifewith the most diverse conditions of psychical disease in the wakingstate have been rightly insisted upon by a number of medical observers.It seemed, therefore, _a priori_, hopeful to apply to the interpretationof dreams methods of investigation which had been tested inpsychopathological processes. Obsessions and those peculiar sensationsof haunting dread remain as strange to normal consciousness as dodreams to our waking consciousness; their origin is as unknown toconsciousness as is that of dreams. It was practical ends that impelledus, in these diseases, to fathom their origin and formation. Experiencehad shown us that a cure and a consequent mastery of the obsessing ideasdid result when once those thoughts, the connecting links between themorbid ideas and the rest of the psychical content, were revealed whichwere heretofore veiled from consciousness. The procedure I employed forthe interpretation of dreams thus arose from psychotherapy.This procedure is readily described, although its practice demandsinstruction and experience. Suppose the patient is suffering fromintense morbid dread. He is requested to direct his attention to theidea in question, without, however, as he has so frequently done,meditating upon it. Every impression about it, without any exception,which occurs to him should be imparted to the doctor. The statementwhich will be perhaps then made, that he cannot concentrate hisattention upon anything at all, is to be countered by assuring him mostpositively that such a blank state of mind is utterly impossible. As amatter of fact, a great number of impressions will soon occur, withwhich others will associate themselves. These will be invariablyaccompanied by the expression of the observer\\'s opinion that they haveno meaning or are unimportant. It will be at once noticed that it isthis self-criticism which prevented the patient from imparting theideas, which had indeed already excluded them from consciousness. If thepatient can be induced to abandon this self-criticism and to pursue thetrains of thought which are yielded by concentrating the attention, mostsignificant matter will be obtained, matter which will be presently seento be clearly linked to the morbid idea in question. Its connection withother ideas will be manifest, and later on will permit the replacementof the morbid idea by a fresh one, which is perfectly adapted topsychical continuity.This is not the place to examine thoroughly the hypothesis upon whichthis experiment rests, or the deductions which follow from itsinvariable success. It must suffice to state that we obtain matterenough for the resolution of every morbid idea if we especially directour attention to the _unbidden_ associations _which disturb ourthoughts_--those which are otherwise put aside by the critic asworthless refuse. If the procedure is exercised on oneself, the bestplan of helping the experiment is to write down at once all one\\'s firstindistinct fancies.I will now point out where this method leads when I apply it to theexamination of dreams. Any dream could be made use of in this way. Fromcertain motives I, however, choose a dream of my own, which appearsconfused and meaningless to my memory, and one which has the advantageof brevity. Probably my dream of last night satisfies the requirements.Its content, fixed immediately after awakening, runs as follows:_\"Company; at table or table d\\'hÃ´te.... Spinach is served. Mrs. E.L.,sitting next to me, gives me her undivided attention, and places herhand familiarly upon my knee. In defence I remove her hand. Then shesays: \\'But you have always had such beautiful eyes.\\'.... I thendistinctly see something like two eyes as a sketch or as the contour ofa spectacle lens....\"_This is the whole dream, or, at all events, all that I can remember. Itappears to me not only obscure and meaningless, but more especially odd.Mrs. E.L. is a person with whom I am scarcely on visiting terms, nor tomy knowledge have I ever desired any more cordial relationship. I havenot seen her for a long time, and do not think there was any mention ofher recently. No emotion whatever accompanied the dream process.Reflecting upon this dream does not make it a bit clearer to my mind. Iwill now, however, present the ideas, without premeditation and withoutcriticism, which introspection yielded. I soon notice that it is anadvantage to break up the dream into its elements, and to search out theideas which link themselves to each fragment._Company; at table or table d\\'hÃ´te._ The recollection of the slightevent with which the evening of yesterday ended is at once called up. Ileft a small party in the company of a friend, who offered to drive mehome in his cab. \"I prefer a taxi,\" he said; \"that gives one such apleasant occupation; there is always something to look at.\" When we werein the cab, and the cab-driver turned the disc so that the first sixtyhellers were visible, I continued the jest. \"We have hardly got in andwe already owe sixty hellers. The taxi always reminds me of the tabled\\'hÃ´te. It makes me avaricious and selfish by continuously reminding meof my debt. It seems to me to mount up too quickly, and I am alwaysafraid that I shall be at a disadvantage, just as I cannot resist attable d\\'hÃ´te the comical fear that I am getting too little, that I mustlook after myself.\" In far-fetched connection with this I quote:  \"To earth, this weary earth, ye bring us,  To guilt ye let us heedless go.\"Another idea about the table d\\'hÃ´te. A few weeks ago I was very crosswith my dear wife at the dinner-table at a Tyrolese health resort,because she was not sufficiently reserved with some neighbors with whomI wished to have absolutely nothing to do. I begged her to occupyherself rather with me than with the strangers. That is just as if I had_been at a disadvantage at the table d\\'hÃ´te_. The contrast between thebehavior of my wife at the table and that of Mrs. E.L. in the dream nowstrikes me: _\"Addresses herself entirely to me.\"_Further, I now notice that the dream is the reproduction of a littlescene which transpired between my wife and myself when I was secretlycourting her. The caressing under cover of the tablecloth was an answerto a wooer\\'s passionate letter. In the dream, however, my wife isreplaced by the unfamiliar E.L.Mrs. E.L. is the daughter of a man to whom I _owed money_! I cannot helpnoticing that here there is revealed an unsuspected connection betweenthe dream content and my thoughts. If the chain of associations befollowed up which proceeds from one element of the dream one is soon ledback to another of its elements. The thoughts evoked by the dream stirup associations which were not noticeable in the dream itself.Is it not customary, when some one expects others to look after hisinterests without any advantage to themselves, to ask the innocentquestion satirically: \"Do you think this will be done _for the sake ofyour beautiful eyes_?\" Hence Mrs. E.L.\\'s speech in the dream. \"You havealways had such beautiful eyes,\" means nothing but \"people always doeverything to you for love of you; you have had _everything fornothing_.\" The contrary is, of course, the truth; I have always paiddearly for whatever kindness others have shown me. Still, the fact that_I had a ride for nothing_ yesterday when my friend drove me home in hiscab must have made an impression upon me.In any case, the friend whose guests we were yesterday has often made mehis debtor. Recently I allowed an opportunity of requiting him to go by.He has had only one present from me, an antique shawl, upon which eyesare painted all round, a so-called Occhiale, as a _charm_ against the_Malocchio_. Moreover, he is an _eye specialist_. That same evening Ihad asked him after a patient whom I had sent to him for _glasses_.As I remarked, nearly all parts of the dream have been brought into thisnew connection. I still might ask why in the dream it was _spinach_that was served up. Because spinach called up a little scene whichrecently occurred at our table. A child, whose _beautiful eyes_ arereally deserving of praise, refused to eat spinach. As a child I wasjust the same; for a long time I loathed _spinach_, until in later lifemy tastes altered, and it became one of my favorite dishes. The mentionof this dish brings my own childhood and that of my child\\'s neartogether. \"You should be glad that you have some spinach,\" his motherhad said to the little gourmet. \"Some children would be very glad to getspinach.\" Thus I am reminded of the parents\\' duties towards theirchildren. Goethe\\'s words--  \"To earth, this weary earth, ye bring us,  To guilt ye let us heedless go\"--take on another meaning in this connection.Here I will stop in order that I may recapitulate the results of theanalysis of the dream. By following the associations which were linkedto the single elements of the dream torn from their context, I have beenled to a series of thoughts and reminiscences where I am bound torecognize interesting expressions of my psychical life. The matteryielded by an analysis of the dream stands in intimate relationship withthe dream content, but this relationship is so special that I shouldnever have been able to have inferred the new discoveries directly fromthe dream itself. The dream was passionless, disconnected, andunintelligible. During the time that I am unfolding the thoughts at theback of the dream I feel intense and well-grounded emotions. Thethoughts themselves fit beautifully together into chains logically boundtogether with certain central ideas which ever repeat themselves. Suchideas not represented in the dream itself are in this instance theantitheses _selfish, unselfish, to be indebted, to work for nothing_. Icould draw closer the threads of the web which analysis has disclosed,and would then be able to show how they all run together into a singleknot; I am debarred from making this work public by considerations of aprivate, not of a scientific, nature. After having cleared up manythings which I do not willingly acknowledge as mine, I should have muchto reveal which had better remain my secret. Why, then, do not I chooseanother dream whose analysis would be more suitable for publication, sothat I could awaken a fairer conviction of the sense and cohesion of theresults disclosed by analysis? The answer is, because every dream whichI investigate leads to the same difficulties and places me under thesame need of discretion; nor should I forgo this difficulty any themore were I to analyze the dream of some one else. That could only bedone when opportunity allowed all concealment to be dropped withoutinjury to those who trusted me.The conclusion which is now forced upon me is that the dream is a _sortof substitution_ for those emotional and intellectual trains of thoughtwhich I attained after complete analysis. I do not yet know the processby which the dream arose from those thoughts, but I perceive that it iswrong to regard the dream as psychically unimportant, a purely physicalprocess which has arisen from the activity of isolated cortical elementsawakened out of sleep.I must further remark that the dream is far shorter than the thoughtswhich I hold it replaces; whilst analysis discovered that the dream wasprovoked by an unimportant occurrence the evening before the dream.Naturally, I would not draw such far-reaching conclusions if only oneanalysis were known to me. Experience has shown me that when theassociations of any dream are honestly followed such a chain of thoughtis revealed, the constituent parts of the dream reappear correctly andsensibly linked together; the slight suspicion that this concatenationwas merely an accident of a single first observation must, therefore,be absolutely relinquished. I regard it, therefore, as my right toestablish this new view by a proper nomenclature. I contrast the dreamwhich my memory evokes with the dream and other added matter revealed byanalysis: the former I call the dream\\'s _manifest content_; the latter,without at first further subdivision, its _latent content_. I arrive attwo new problems hitherto unformulated: (1) What is the psychicalprocess which has transformed the latent content of the dream into itsmanifest content? (2) What is the motive or the motives which have madesuch transformation exigent? The process by which the change from latentto manifest content is executed I name the _dream-work_. In contrastwith this is the _work of analysis_, which produces the reversetransformation. The other problems of the dream--the inquiry as to itsstimuli, as to the source of its materials, as to its possible purpose,the function of dreaming, the forgetting of dreams--these I will discussin connection with the latent dream-content.I shall take every care to avoid a confusion between the _manifest_ andthe _latent content_, for I ascribe all the contradictory as well as theincorrect accounts of dream-life to the ignorance of this latentcontent, now first laid bare through analysis.The conversion of the latent dream thoughts into those manifest deservesour close study as the first known example of the transformation ofpsychical stuff from one mode of expression into another. From a mode ofexpression which, moreover, is readily intelligible into another whichwe can only penetrate by effort and with guidance, although this newmode must be equally reckoned as an effort of our own psychicalactivity. From the standpoint of the relationship of latent to manifestdream-content, dreams can be divided into three classes. We can, in thefirst place, distinguish those dreams which have a _meaning_ and are, atthe same time, _intelligible_, which allow us to penetrate into ourpsychical life without further ado. Such dreams are numerous; they areusually short, and, as a general rule, do not seem very noticeable,because everything remarkable or exciting surprise is absent. Theiroccurrence is, moreover, a strong argument against the doctrine whichderives the dream from the isolated activity of certain corticalelements. All signs of a lowered or subdivided psychical activity arewanting. Yet we never raise any objection to characterizing them asdreams, nor do we confound them with the products of our waking life.A second group is formed by those dreams which are indeed self-coherentand have a distinct meaning, but appear strange because we are unable toreconcile their meaning with our mental life. That is the case when wedream, for instance, that some dear relative has died of plague when weknow of no ground for expecting, apprehending, or assuming anything ofthe sort; we can only ask ourself wonderingly: \"What brought that intomy head?\" To the third group those dreams belong which are void of bothmeaning and intelligibility; they are _incoherent, complicated, andmeaningless_. The overwhelming number of our dreams partake of thischaracter, and this has given rise to the contemptuous attitude towardsdreams and the medical theory of their limited psychical activity. It isespecially in the longer and more complicated dream-plots that signs ofincoherence are seldom missing.The contrast between manifest and latent dream-content is clearly onlyof value for the dreams of the second and more especially for those ofthe third class. Here are problems which are only solved when themanifest dream is replaced by its latent content; it was an example ofthis kind, a complicated and unintelligible dream, that we subjected toanalysis. Against our expectation we, however, struck upon reasons whichprevented a complete cognizance of the latent dream thought. On therepetition of this same experience we were forced to the suppositionthat there is an _intimate bond, with laws of its own, between theunintelligible and complicated nature of the dream and the difficultiesattending communication of the thoughts connected with the dream_.Before investigating the nature of this bond, it will be advantageous toturn our attention to the more readily intelligible dreams of the firstclass where, the manifest and latent content being identical, the dreamwork seems to be omitted.The investigation of these dreams is also advisable from anotherstandpoint. The dreams of _children_ are of this nature; they have ameaning, and are not bizarre. This, by the way, is a further objectionto reducing dreams to a dissociation of cerebral activity in sleep, forwhy should such a lowering of psychical functions belong to the natureof sleep in adults, but not in children? We are, however, fullyjustified in expecting that the explanation of psychical processes inchildren, essentially simplified as they may be, should serve as anindispensable preparation towards the psychology of the adult.I shall therefore cite some examples of dreams which I have gatheredfrom children. A girl of nineteen months was made to go without foodfor a day because she had been sick in the morning, and, according tonurse, had made herself ill through eating strawberries. During thenight, after her day of fasting, she was heard calling out her nameduring sleep, and adding: \"_Tawberry, eggs, pap_.\" She is dreaming thatshe is eating, and selects out of her menu exactly what she supposes shewill not get much of just now.The same kind of dream about a forbidden dish was that of a little boyof twenty-two months. The day before he was told to offer his uncle apresent of a small basket of cherries, of which the child was, ofcourse, only allowed one to taste. He woke up with the joyful news:\"Hermann eaten up all the cherries.\"A girl of three and a half years had made during the day a sea tripwhich was too short for her, and she cried when she had to get out ofthe boat. The next morning her story was that during the night she hadbeen on the sea, thus continuing the interrupted trip.A boy of five and a half years was not at all pleased with his partyduring a walk in the Dachstein region. Whenever a new peak came intosight he asked if that were the Dachstein, and, finally, refused toaccompany the party to the waterfall. His behavior was ascribed tofatigue; but a better explanation was forthcoming when the next morninghe told his dream: _he had ascended the Dachstein_. Obviously heexpected the ascent of the Dachstein to be the object of the excursion,and was vexed by not getting a glimpse of the mountain. The dream gavehim what the day had withheld. The dream of a girl of six was similar;her father had cut short the walk before reaching the promised objectiveon account of the lateness of the hour. On the way back she noticed asignpost giving the name of another place for excursions; her fatherpromised to take her there also some other day. She greeted her fathernext day with the news that she had dreamt that _her father had beenwith her to both places_.What is common in all these dreams is obvious. They completely satisfywishes excited during the day which remain unrealized. They are simplyand undisguisedly realizations of wishes.The following child-dream, not quite understandable at first sight, isnothing else than a wish realized. On account of poliomyelitis a girl,not quite four years of age, was brought from the country into town, andremained over night with a childless aunt in a big--for her, naturally,huge--bed. The next morning she stated that she had dreamt that _thebed was much too small for her, so that she could find no place in it_.To explain this dream as a wish is easy when we remember that to be\"big\" is a frequently expressed wish of all children. The bigness of thebed reminded Miss Little-Would-be-Big only too forcibly of hersmallness. This nasty situation became righted in her dream, and shegrew so big that the bed now became too small for her.Even when children\\'s dreams are complicated and polished, theircomprehension as a realization of desire is fairly evident. A boy ofeight dreamt that he was being driven with Achilles in a war-chariot,guided by Diomedes. The day before he was assiduously reading aboutgreat heroes. It is easy to show that he took these heroes as hismodels, and regretted that he was not living in those days.From this short collection a further characteristic of the dreams ofchildren is manifest--_their connection with the life of the day_. Thedesires which are realized in these dreams are left over from the dayor, as a rule, the day previous, and the feeling has become intentlyemphasized and fixed during the day thoughts. Accidental and indifferentmatters, or what must appear so to the child, find no acceptance in thecontents of the dream.Innumerable instances of such dreams of the infantile type can be foundamong adults also, but, as mentioned, these are mostly exactly like themanifest content. Thus, a random selection of persons will generallyrespond to thirst at night-time with a dream about drinking, thusstriving to get rid of the sensation and to let sleep continue. Manypersons frequently have these comforting _dreams_ before waking, justwhen they are called. They then dream that they are already up, thatthey are washing, or already in school, at the office, etc., where theyought to be at a given time. The night before an intended journey onenot infrequently dreams that one has already arrived at the destination;before going to a play or to a party the dream not infrequentlyanticipates, in impatience, as it were, the expected pleasure. At othertimes the dream expresses the realization of the desire somewhatindirectly; some connection, some sequel must be known--the first steptowards recognizing the desire. Thus, when a husband related to me thedream of his young wife, that her monthly period had begun, I had tobethink myself that the young wife would have expected a pregnancy ifthe period had been absent. The dream is then a sign of pregnancy. Itsmeaning is that it shows the wish realized that pregnancy should notoccur just yet. Under unusual and extreme circumstances, these dreamsof the infantile type become very frequent. The leader of a polarexpedition tells us, for instance, that during the wintering amid theice the crew, with their monotonous diet and slight rations, dreamtregularly, like children, of fine meals, of mountains of tobacco, and ofhome.It is not uncommon that out of some long, complicated and intricatedream one specially lucid part stands out containing unmistakably therealization of a desire, but bound up with much unintelligible matter.On more frequently analyzing the seemingly more transparent dreams ofadults, it is astonishing to discover that these are rarely as simple asthe dreams of children, and that they cover another meaning beyond thatof the realization of a wish.It would certainly be a simple and convenient solution of the riddle ifthe work of analysis made it at all possible for us to trace themeaningless and intricate dreams of adults back to the infantile type,to the realization of some intensely experienced desire of the day. Butthere is no warrant for such an expectation. Their dreams are generallyfull of the most indifferent and bizarre matter, and no trace of therealization of the wish is to be found in their content.Before leaving these infantile dreams, which are obviously unrealizeddesires, we must not fail to mention another chief characteristic ofdreams, one that has been long noticed, and one which stands out mostclearly in this class. I can replace any of these dreams by a phraseexpressing a desire. If the sea trip had only lasted longer; if I wereonly washed and dressed; if I had only been allowed to keep the cherriesinstead of giving them to my uncle. But the dream gives something morethan the choice, for here the desire is already realized; itsrealization is real and actual. The dream presentations consist chiefly,if not wholly, of scenes and mainly of visual sense images. Hence a kindof transformation is not entirely absent in this class of dreams, andthis may be fairly designated as the dream work. _An idea merelyexisting in the region of possibility is replaced by a vision of itsaccomplishment._IITHE DREAM MECHANISMWe are compelled to assume that such transformation of scene has alsotaken place in intricate dreams, though we do not know whether it hasencountered any possible desire. The dream instanced at thecommencement, which we analyzed somewhat thoroughly, did give usoccasion in two places to suspect something of the kind. Analysisbrought out that my wife was occupied with others at table, and that Idid not like it; in the dream itself _exactly the opposite_ occurs, forthe person who replaces my wife gives me her undivided attention. Butcan one wish for anything pleasanter after a disagreeable incident thanthat the exact contrary should have occurred, just as the dream has it?The stinging thought in the analysis, that I have never had anything fornothing, is similarly connected with the woman\\'s remark in the dream:\"You have always had such beautiful eyes.\" Some portion of theopposition between the latent and manifest content of the dream must betherefore derived from the realization of a wish.Another manifestation of the dream work which all incoherent dreams havein common is still more noticeable. Choose any instance, and compare thenumber of separate elements in it, or the extent of the dream, ifwritten down, with the dream thoughts yielded by analysis, and of whichbut a trace can be refound in the dream itself. There can be no doubtthat the dream working has resulted in an extraordinary compression or_condensation_. It is not at first easy to form an opinion as to theextent of the condensation; the more deeply you go into the analysis,the more deeply you are impressed by it. There will be found no factorin the dream whence the chains of associations do not lead in two ormore directions, no scene which has not been pieced together out of twoor more impressions and events. For instance, I once dreamt about a kindof swimming-bath where the bathers suddenly separated in all directions;at one place on the edge a person stood bending towards one of thebathers as if to drag him out. The scene was a composite one, made upout of an event that occurred at the time of puberty, and of twopictures, one of which I had seen just shortly before the dream. The twopictures were The Surprise in the Bath, from Schwind\\'s Cycle of theMelusine (note the bathers suddenly separating), and The Flood, by anItalian master. The little incident was that I once witnessed a lady,who had tarried in the swimming-bath until the men\\'s hour, being helpedout of the water by the swimming-master. The scene in the dream whichwas selected for analysis led to a whole group of reminiscences, eachone of which had contributed to the dream content. First of all came thelittle episode from the time of my courting, of which I have alreadyspoken; the pressure of a hand under the table gave rise in the dream tothe \"under the table,\" which I had subsequently to find a place for inmy recollection. There was, of course, at the time not a word about\"undivided attention.\" Analysis taught me that this factor is therealization of a desire through its contradictory and related to thebehavior of my wife at the table d\\'hÃ´te. An exactly similar and muchmore important episode of our courtship, one which separated us for anentire day, lies hidden behind this recent recollection. The intimacy,the hand resting upon the knee, refers to a quite different connectionand to quite other persons. This element in the dream becomes again thestarting-point of two distinct series of reminiscences, and so on.The stuff of the dream thoughts which has been accumulated for theformation of the dream scene must be naturally fit for this application.There must be one or more common factors. The dream work proceeds likeFrancis Galton with his family photographs. The different elements areput one on top of the other; what is common to the composite picturestands out clearly, the opposing details cancel each other. This processof reproduction partly explains the wavering statements, of a peculiarvagueness, in so many elements of the dream. For the interpretation ofdreams this rule holds good: When analysis discloses _uncertainty_, asto _either_--_or_ read _and_, _taking_ each section of the apparentalternatives as a separate outlet for a series of impressions.When there is nothing in common between the dream thoughts, the dreamwork takes the trouble to create a something, in order to make a commonpresentation feasible in the dream. The simplest way to approximate twodream thoughts, which have as yet nothing in common, consists in makingsuch a change in the actual expression of one idea as will meet a slightresponsive recasting in the form of the other idea. The process isanalogous to that of rhyme, when consonance supplies the desired commonfactor. A good deal of the dream work consists in the creation of thosefrequently very witty, but often exaggerated, digressions. These varyfrom the common presentation in the dream content to dream thoughtswhich are as varied as are the causes in form and essence which giverise to them. In the analysis of our example of a dream, I find a likecase of the transformation of a thought in order that it might agreewith another essentially foreign one. In following out the analysis Istruck upon the thought: _I should like to have something for nothing_.But this formula is not serviceable to the dream. Hence it is replacedby another one: \"I should like to enjoy something free of cost.\"[1] Theword \"kost\" (taste), with its double meaning, is appropriate to a tabled\\'hÃ´te; it, moreover, is in place through the special sense in thedream. At home if there is a dish which the children decline, theirmother first tries gentle persuasion, with a \"Just taste it.\" That thedream work should unhesitatingly use the double meaning of the word iscertainly remarkable; ample experience has shown, however, that theoccurrence is quite usual.Through condensation of the dream certain constituent parts of itscontent are explicable which are peculiar to the dream life alone, andwhich are not found in the waking state. Such are the composite andmixed persons, the extraordinary mixed figures, creations comparablewith the fantastic animal compositions of Orientals; a moment\\'s thoughtand these are reduced to unity, whilst the fancies of the dream are everformed anew in an inexhaustible profusion. Every one knows such imagesin his own dreams; manifold are their origins. I can build up a personby borrowing one feature from one person and one from another, or bygiving to the form of one the name of another in my dream. I can alsovisualize one person, but place him in a position which has occurred toanother. There is a meaning in all these cases when different personsare amalgamated into one substitute. Such cases denote an \"and,\" a \"justlike,\" a comparison of the original person from a certain point of view,a comparison which can be also realized in the dream itself. As a rule,however, the identity of the blended persons is only discoverable byanalysis, and is only indicated in the dream content by the formation ofthe \"combined\" person.The same diversity in their ways of formation and the same rules for itssolution hold good also for the innumerable medley of dream contents,examples of which I need scarcely adduce. Their strangeness quitedisappears when we resolve not to place them on a level with the objectsof perception as known to us when awake, but to remember that theyrepresent the art of dream condensation by an exclusion of unnecessarydetail. Prominence is given to the common character of the combination.Analysis must also generally supply the common features. The dream sayssimply: _All these things have an \"x\" in common_. The decomposition ofthese mixed images by analysis is often the quickest way to aninterpretation of the dream. Thus I once dreamt that I was sitting withone of my former university tutors on a bench, which was undergoing arapid continuous movement amidst other benches. This was a combinationof lecture-room and moving staircase. I will not pursue the furtherresult of the thought. Another time I was sitting in a carriage, and onmy lap an object in shape like a top-hat, which, however, was made oftransparent glass. The scene at once brought to my mind the proverb: \"Hewho keeps his hat in his hand will travel safely through the land.\" By aslight turn the _glass hat_ reminded me of _Auer\\'s light_, and I knewthat I was about to invent something which was to make me as rich andindependent as his invention had made my countryman, Dr. Auer, ofWelsbach; then I should be able to travel instead of remaining inVienna. In the dream I was traveling with my invention, with the, it istrue, rather awkward glass top-hat. The dream work is peculiarly adeptat representing two contradictory conceptions by means of the same mixedimage. Thus, for instance, a woman dreamt of herself carrying a tallflower-stalk, as in the picture of the Annunciation (Chastity-Mary isher own name), but the stalk was bedecked with thick white blossomsresembling camellias (contrast with chastity: La dame aux Camelias).A great deal of what we have called \"dream condensation\" can be thusformulated. Each one of the elements of the dream content is_overdetermined_ by the matter of the dream thoughts; it is not derivedfrom one element of these thoughts, but from a whole series. These arenot necessarily interconnected in any way, but may belong to the mostdiverse spheres of thought. The dream element truly represents all thisdisparate matter in the dream content. Analysis, moreover, disclosesanother side of the relationship between dream content and dreamthoughts. Just as one element of the dream leads to associations withseveral dream thoughts, so, as a rule, the _one dream thought representsmore than one dream element_. The threads of the association do notsimply converge from the dream thoughts to the dream content, but on theway they overlap and interweave in every way.Next to the transformation of one thought in the scene (its\"dramatization\"), condensation is the most important and mostcharacteristic feature of the dream work. We have as yet no clue as tothe motive calling for such compression of the content.In the complicated and intricate dreams with which we are now concerned,condensation and dramatization do not wholly account for the differencebetween dream contents and dream thoughts. There is evidence of a thirdfactor, which deserves careful consideration.When I have arrived at an understanding of the dream thoughts by myanalysis I notice, above all, that the matter of the manifest is verydifferent from that of the latent dream content. That is, I admit, onlyan apparent difference which vanishes on closer investigation, for inthe end I find the whole dream content carried out in the dreamthoughts, nearly all the dream thoughts again represented in the dreamcontent. Nevertheless, there does remain a certain amount of difference.The essential content which stood out clearly and broadly in the dreammust, after analysis, rest satisfied with a very subordinate rÃ´le amongthe dream thoughts. These very dream thoughts which, going by myfeelings, have a claim to the greatest importance are either not presentat all in the dream content, or are represented by some remote allusionin some obscure region of the dream. I can thus describe thesephenomena: _During the dream work the psychical intensity of thosethoughts and conceptions to which it properly pertains flows to otherswhich, in my judgment, have no claim to such emphasis_. There is noother process which contributes so much to concealment of the dream\\'smeaning and to make the connection between the dream content and dreamideas irrecognizable. During this process, which I will call _the dreamdisplacement_, I notice also the psychical intensity, significance, oremotional nature of the thoughts become transposed in sensory vividness.What was clearest in the dream seems to me, without furtherconsideration, the most important; but often in some obscure element ofthe dream I can recognize the most direct offspring of the principaldream thought.I could only designate this dream displacement as the _transvaluation ofpsychical values_. The phenomena will not have been considered in allits bearings unless I add that this displacement or transvaluation isshared by different dreams in extremely varying degrees. There aredreams which take place almost without any displacement. These have thesame time, meaning, and intelligibility as we found in the dreams whichrecorded a desire. In other dreams not a bit of the dream idea hasretained its own psychical value, or everything essential in these dreamideas has been replaced by unessentials, whilst every kind of transitionbetween these conditions can be found. The more obscure and intricate adream is, the greater is the part to be ascribed to the impetus ofdisplacement in its formation.The example that we chose for analysis shows, at least, this much ofdisplacement--that its content has a different center of interest fromthat of the dream ideas. In the forefront of the dream content the mainscene appears as if a woman wished to make advances to me; in the dreamidea the chief interest rests on the desire to enjoy disinterested lovewhich shall \"cost nothing\"; this idea lies at the back of the talk aboutthe beautiful eyes and the far-fetched allusion to \"spinach.\"If we abolish the dream displacement, we attain through analysis quitecertain conclusions regarding two problems of the dream which are mostdisputed--as to what provokes a dream at all, and as to the connectionof the dream with our waking life. There are dreams which at once exposetheir links with the events of the day; in others no trace of such aconnection can be found. By the aid of analysis it can be shown thatevery dream, without any exception, is linked up with our impression ofthe day, or perhaps it would be more correct to say of the day previousto the dream. The impressions which have incited the dream may be soimportant that we are not surprised at our being occupied with themwhilst awake; in this case we are right in saying that the dream carrieson the chief interest of our waking life. More usually, however, whenthe dream contains anything relating to the impressions of the day, itis so trivial, unimportant, and so deserving of oblivion, that we canonly recall it with an effort. The dream content appears, then, evenwhen coherent and intelligible, to be concerned with those indifferenttrifles of thought undeserving of our waking interest. The depreciationof dreams is largely due to the predominance of the indifferent and theworthless in their content.Analysis destroys the appearance upon which this derogatory judgment isbased. When the dream content discloses nothing but some indifferentimpression as instigating the dream, analysis ever indicates somesignificant event, which has been replaced by something indifferentwith which it has entered into abundant associations. Where the dream isconcerned with uninteresting and unimportant conceptions, analysisreveals the numerous associative paths which connect the trivial withthe momentous in the psychical estimation of the individual. _It is onlythe action of displacement if what is indifferent obtains recognition inthe dream content instead of those impressions which are really thestimulus, or instead of the things of real interest_. In answering thequestion as to what provokes the dream, as to the connection of thedream, in the daily troubles, we must say, in terms of the insight givenus by replacing the manifest latent dream content: _The dream does nevertrouble itself about things which are not deserving of our concernduring the day, and trivialities which do not trouble us during the dayhave no power to pursue us whilst asleep_.What provoked the dream in the example which we have analyzed? Thereally unimportant event, that a friend invited me to a _free ride inhis cab_. The table d\\'hÃ´te scene in the dream contains an allusion tothis indifferent motive, for in conversation I had brought the taxiparallel with the table d\\'hÃ´te. But I can indicate the important eventwhich has as its substitute the trivial one. A few days before I haddisbursed a large sum of money for a member of my family who is verydear to me. Small wonder, says the dream thought, if this person isgrateful to me for this--this love is not cost-free. But love that shallcost nothing is one of the prime thoughts of the dream. The fact thatshortly before this I had had several _drives_ with the relative inquestion puts the one drive with my friend in a position to recall theconnection with the other person. The indifferent impression which, bysuch ramifications, provokes the dream is subservient to anothercondition which is not true of the real source of the dream--theimpression must be a recent one, everything arising from the day of thedream.I cannot leave the question of dream displacement without theconsideration of a remarkable process in the formation of dreams inwhich condensation and displacement work together towards one end. Incondensation we have already considered the case where two conceptionsin the dream having something in common, some point of contact, arereplaced in the dream content by a mixed image, where the distinct germcorresponds to what is common, and the indistinct secondarymodifications to what is distinctive. If displacement is added tocondensation, there is no formation of a mixed image, but a _commonmean_ which bears the same relationship to the individual elements asdoes the resultant in the parallelogram of forces to its components. Inone of my dreams, for instance, there is talk of an injection with_propyl_. On first analysis I discovered an indifferent but trueincident where _amyl_ played a part as the excitant of the dream. Icannot yet vindicate the exchange of amyl for propyl. To the round ofideas of the same dream, however, there belongs the recollection of myfirst visit to Munich, when the _Propyloea_ struck me. The attendantcircumstances of the analysis render it admissible that the influence ofthis second group of conceptions caused the displacement of amyl topropyl. _Propyl_ is, so to say, the mean idea between _amyl_ and_propyloea_; it got into the dream as a kind of _compromise_ bysimultaneous condensation and displacement.The need of discovering some motive for this bewildering work of thedream is even more called for in the case of displacement than incondensation.Although the work of displacement must be held mainly responsible if thedream thoughts are not refound or recognized in the dream content(unless the motive of the changes be guessed), it is another and milderkind of transformation which will be considered with the dream thoughtswhich leads to the discovery of a new but readily understood act of thedream work. The first dream thoughts which are unravelled by analysisfrequently strike one by their unusual wording. They do not appear to beexpressed in the sober form which our thinking prefers; rather are theyexpressed symbolically by allegories and metaphors like the figurativelanguage of the poets. It is not difficult to find the motives for thisdegree of constraint in the expression of dream ideas. The dream contentconsists chiefly of visual scenes; hence the dream ideas must, in thefirst place, be prepared to make use of these forms of presentation.Conceive that a political leader\\'s or a barrister\\'s address had to betransposed into pantomime, and it will be easy to understand thetransformations to which the dream work is constrained by regard forthis _dramatization of the dream content_.Around the psychical stuff of dream thoughts there are ever foundreminiscences of impressions, not infrequently of earlychildhood--scenes which, as a rule, have been visually grasped. Wheneverpossible, this portion of the dream ideas exercises a definite influenceupon the modelling of the dream content; it works like a center ofcrystallization, by attracting and rearranging the stuff of the dreamthoughts. The scene of the dream is not infrequently nothing but amodified repetition, complicated by interpolations of events that haveleft such an impression; the dream but very seldom reproduces accurateand unmixed reproductions of real scenes.The dream content does not, however, consist exclusively of scenes, butit also includes scattered fragments of visual images, conversations,and even bits of unchanged thoughts. It will be perhaps to the point ifwe instance in the briefest way the means of dramatization which are atthe disposal of the dream work for the repetition of the dream thoughtsin the peculiar language of the dream.The dream thoughts which we learn from the analysis exhibit themselvesas a psychical complex of the most complicated superstructure. Theirparts stand in the most diverse relationship to each other; they formbackgrounds and foregrounds, stipulations, digressions, illustrations,demonstrations, and protestations. It may be said to be almost the rulethat one train of thought is followed by its contradictory. No featureknown to our reason whilst awake is absent. If a dream is to grow out ofall this, the psychical matter is submitted to a pressure whichcondenses it extremely, to an inner shrinking and displacement, creatingat the same time fresh surfaces, to a selective interweaving among theconstituents best adapted for the construction of these scenes. Havingregard to the origin of this stuff, the term _regression_ can be fairlyapplied to this process. The logical chains which hitherto held thepsychical stuff together become lost in this transformation to the dreamcontent. The dream work takes on, as it were, only the essential contentof the dream thoughts for elaboration. It is left to analysis to restorethe connection which the dream work has destroyed.The dream\\'s means of expression must therefore be regarded as meager incomparison with those of our imagination, though the dream does notrenounce all claims to the restitution of logical relation to the dreamthoughts. It rather succeeds with tolerable frequency in replacing theseby formal characters of its own.By reason of the undoubted connection existing between all the parts ofdream thoughts, the dream is able to embody this matter into a singlescene. It upholds a _logical connection_ as _approximation in time andspace_, just as the painter, who groups all the poets for his picture ofParnassus who, though they have never been all together on a mountainpeak, yet form ideally a community. The dream continues this method ofpresentation in individual dreams, and often when it displays twoelements close together in the dream content it warrants some specialinner connection between what they represent in the dream thoughts. Itshould be, moreover, observed that all the dreams of one night prove onanalysis to originate from the same sphere of thought.The causal connection between two ideas is either left withoutpresentation, or replaced by two different long portions of dreams oneafter the other. This presentation is frequently a reversed one, thebeginning of the dream being the deduction, and its end the hypothesis.The direct _transformation_ of one thing into another in the dream seemsto serve the relationship of _cause_ and _effect_.The dream never utters the _alternative \"either-or,\"_ but accepts bothas having equal rights in the same connection. When \"either-or\" is usedin the reproduction of dreams, it is, as I have already mentioned, to bereplaced by \"_and_.\"Conceptions which stand in opposition to one another are preferablyexpressed in dreams by the same element.[2] There seems no \"not\" indreams. Opposition between two ideas, the relation of conversion, isrepresented in dreams in a very remarkable way. It is expressed by thereversal of another part of the dream content just as if by way ofappendix. We shall later on deal with another form of expressingdisagreement. The common dream sensation of _movement checked_ servesthe purpose of representing disagreement of impulses--a _conflict of thewill_.Only one of the logical relationships--that of _similarity, identity,agreement_--is found highly developed in the mechanism of dreamformation. Dream work makes use of these cases as a starting-point forcondensation, drawing together everything which shows such agreement toa _fresh unity_.These short, crude observations naturally do not suffice as an estimateof the abundance of the dream\\'s formal means of presenting the logicalrelationships of the dream thoughts. In this respect, individual dreamsare worked up more nicely or more carelessly, our text will have beenfollowed more or less closely, auxiliaries of the dream work will havebeen taken more or less into consideration. In the latter case theyappear obscure, intricate, incoherent. When the dream appears openlyabsurd, when it contains an obvious paradox in its content, it is so ofpurpose. Through its apparent disregard of all logical claims, itexpresses a part of the intellectual content of the dream ideas.Absurdity in the dream denotes _disagreement, scorn, disdain_ in thedream thoughts. As this explanation is in entire disagreement with theview that the dream owes its origin to dissociated, uncritical cerebralactivity, I will emphasize my view by an example:_\"One of my acquaintances, Mr. M----, has been attacked by no less aperson than Goethe in an essay with, we all maintain, unwarrantableviolence. Mr. M---- has naturally been ruined by this attack. Hecomplains very bitterly of this at a dinner-party, but his respect forGoethe has not diminished through this personal experience. I nowattempt to clear up the chronological relations which strike me asimprobable. Goethe died in 1832. As his attack upon Mr. M---- must, ofcourse, have taken place before, Mr. M---- must have been then a veryyoung man. It seems to me plausible that he was eighteen. I am notcertain, however, what year we are actually in, and the wholecalculation falls into obscurity. The attack was, moreover, containedin Goethe\\'s well-known essay on \\'Nature.\\'\"_The absurdity of the dream becomes the more glaring when I state thatMr. M---- is a young business man without any poetical or literaryinterests. My analysis of the dream will show what method there is inthis madness. The dream has derived its material from three sources:1. Mr. M----, to whom I was introduced at a dinner-party, begged me oneday to examine his elder brother, who showed signs of mental trouble. Inconversation with the patient, an unpleasant episode occurred. Withoutthe slightest occasion he disclosed one of his brother\\'s _youthfulescapades_. I had asked the patient the _year of his birth_ (_year ofdeath_ in dream), and led him to various calculations which might showup his want of memory.2. A medical journal which displayed my name among others on the coverhad published a _ruinous_ review of a book by my friend F---- of Berlin,from the pen of a very _juvenile_ reviewer. I communicated with theeditor, who, indeed, expressed his regret, but would not promise anyredress. Thereupon I broke off my connection with the paper; in myletter of resignation I expressed the hope that our _personal relationswould not suffer from this_. Here is the real source of the dream. Thederogatory reception of my friend\\'s work had made a deep impression uponme. In my judgment, it contained a fundamental biological discoverywhich only now, several years later, commences to find favor among theprofessors.3. A little while before, a patient gave me the medical history of herbrother, who, exclaiming \"_Nature, Nature!_\" had gone out of his mind.The doctors considered that the exclamation arose from a study of_Goethe\\'s_ beautiful essay, and indicated that the patient had beenoverworking. I expressed the opinion that it seemed more _plausible_ tome that the exclamation \"Nature!\" was to be taken in that sexual meaningknown also to the less educated in our country. It seemed to me thatthis view had something in it, because the unfortunate youth afterwardsmutilated his genital organs. The patient was eighteen years old whenthe attack occurred.The first person in the dream-thoughts behind the ego was my friend whohad been so scandalously treated. _\"I now attempted to clear up thechronological relation.\"_ My friend\\'s book deals with the chronologicalrelations of life, and, amongst other things, correlates _Goethe\\'s_duration of life with a number of days in many ways important tobiology. The ego is, however, represented as a general paralytic (_\"Iam not certain what year we are actually in\"_). The dream exhibits myfriend as behaving like a general paralytic, and thus riots inabsurdity. But the dream thoughts run ironically. \"Of course he is amadman, a fool, and you are the genius who understands all about it. Butshouldn\\'t it be the _other way round_?\" This inversion obviously tookplace in the dream when Goethe attacked the young man, which is absurd,whilst any one, however young, can to-day easily attack the greatGoethe.I am prepared to maintain that no dream is inspired by other thanegoistic emotions. The ego in the dream does not, indeed, represent onlymy friend, but stands for myself also. I identify myself with himbecause the fate of his discovery appears to me typical of theacceptance of _my own_. If I were to publish my own theory, which givessexuality predominance in the Ã¦tiology of psychoneurotic disorders (seethe allusion to the eighteen-year-old patient--_\"Nature, Nature!\"_), thesame criticism would be leveled at me, and it would even now meet withthe same contempt.When I follow out the dream thoughts closely, I ever find only _scorn_and _contempt_ as _correlated with the dream\\'s absurdity_. It is wellknown that the discovery of a cracked sheep\\'s skull on the Lido inVenice gave Goethe the hint for the so-called vertebral theory of theskull. My friend plumes himself on having as a student raised a hubbubfor the resignation of an aged professor who had done good work(including some in this very subject of comparative anatomy), but who,on account of _decrepitude_, had become quite incapable of teaching. Theagitation my friend inspired was so successful because in the GermanUniversities an _age limit_ is not demanded for academic work. _Age isno protection against folly._ In the hospital here I had for years thehonor to serve under a chief who, long fossilized, was for decadesnotoriously _feebleminded_, and was yet permitted to continue in hisresponsible office. A trait, after the manner of the find in the Lido,forces itself upon me here. It was to this man that some youthfulcolleagues in the hospital adapted the then popular slang of that day:\"No Goethe has written that,\" \"No Schiller composed that,\" etc.We have not exhausted our valuation of the dream work. In addition tocondensation, displacement, and definite arrangement of the psychicalmatter, we must ascribe to it yet another activity--one which is,indeed, not shared by every dream. I shall not treat this position ofthe dream work exhaustively; I will only point out that the readiestway to arrive at a conception of it is to take for granted, probablyunfairly, that it _only subsequently influences the dream content whichhas already been built up_. Its mode of action thus consists in socoÃ¶rdinating the parts of the dream that these coalesce to a coherentwhole, to a dream composition. The dream gets a kind of faÃ§ade which, itis true, does not conceal the whole of its content. There is a sort ofpreliminary explanation to be strengthened by interpolations and slightalterations. Such elaboration of the dream content must not be toopronounced; the misconception of the dream thoughts to which it givesrise is merely superficial, and our first piece of work in analyzing adream is to get rid of these early attempts at interpretation.The motives for this part of the dream work are easily gauged. Thisfinal elaboration of the dream is due to a _regard forintelligibility_--a fact at once betraying the origin of an action whichbehaves towards the actual dream content just as our normal psychicalaction behaves towards some proffered perception that is to our liking.The dream content is thus secured under the pretense of certainexpectations, is perceptually classified by the supposition of itsintelligibility, thereby risking its falsification, whilst, in fact, themost extraordinary misconceptions arise if the dream can be correlatedwith nothing familiar. Every one is aware that we are unable to look atany series of unfamiliar signs, or to listen to a discussion of unknownwords, without at once making perpetual changes through _our regard forintelligibility_, through our falling back upon what is familiar.We can call those dreams _properly made up_ which are the result of anelaboration in every way analogous to the psychical action of our wakinglife. In other dreams there is no such action; not even an attempt ismade to bring about order and meaning. We regard the dream as \"quitemad,\" because on awaking it is with this last-named part of the dreamwork, the dream elaboration, that we identify ourselves. So far,however, as our analysis is concerned, the dream, which resembles amedley of disconnected fragments, is of as much value as the one with asmooth and beautifully polished surface. In the former case we arespared, to some extent, the trouble of breaking down thesuper-elaboration of the dream content.All the same, it would be an error to see in the dream faÃ§ade nothingbut the misunderstood and somewhat arbitrary elaboration of the dreamcarried out at the instance of our psychical life. Wishes and phantasiesare not infrequently employed in the erection of this faÃ§ade, whichwere already fashioned in the dream thoughts; they are akin to those ofour waking life--\"day-dreams,\" as they are very properly called. Thesewishes and phantasies, which analysis discloses in our dreams at night,often present themselves as repetitions and refashionings of the scenesof infancy. Thus the dream faÃ§ade may show us directly the true core ofthe dream, distorted through admixture with other matter.Beyond these four activities there is nothing else to be discovered inthe dream work. If we keep closely to the definition that dream workdenotes the transference of dream thoughts to dream content, we arecompelled to say that the dream work is not creative; it develops nofancies of its own, it judges nothing, decides nothing. It does nothingbut prepare the matter for condensation and displacement, and refashionsit for dramatization, to which must be added the inconstant last-namedmechanism--that of explanatory elaboration. It is true that a good dealis found in the dream content which might be understood as the result ofanother and more intellectual performance; but analysis showsconclusively every time that these _intellectual operations were alreadypresent in the dream thoughts, and have only been taken over by thedream content_. A syllogism in the dream is nothing other than therepetition of a syllogism in the dream thoughts; it seems inoffensive ifit has been transferred to the dream without alteration; it becomesabsurd if in the dream work it has been transferred to other matter. Acalculation in the dream content simply means that there was acalculation in the dream thoughts; whilst this is always correct, thecalculation in the dream can furnish the silliest results by thecondensation of its factors and the displacement of the same operationsto other things. Even speeches which are found in the dream content arenot new compositions; they prove to be pieced together out of speecheswhich have been made or heard or read; the words are faithfully copied,but the occasion of their utterance is quite overlooked, and theirmeaning is most violently changed.It is, perhaps, not superfluous to support these assertions by examples:1. _A seemingly inoffensive, well-made dream of a patient. She was goingto market with her cook, who carried the basket. The butcher said to herwhen she asked him for something: \"That is all gone,\" and wished to giveher something else, remarking; \"That\\'s very good.\" She declines, andgoes to the greengrocer, who wants to sell her a peculiar vegetablewhich is bound up in bundles and of a black color. She says: \"I don\\'tknow that; I won\\'t take it.\"_The remark \"That is all gone\" arose from the treatment. A few daysbefore I said myself to the patient that the earliest reminiscences ofchildhood _are all gone_ as such, but are replaced by transferences anddreams. Thus I am the butcher.The second remark, _\"I don\\'t know that\"_ arose in a very differentconnection. The day before she had herself called out in rebuke to thecook (who, moreover, also appears in the dream): \"_Behave yourselfproperly_; I don\\'t know _that_\"--that is, \"I don\\'t know this kind ofbehavior; I won\\'t have it.\" The more harmless portion of this speech wasarrived at by a displacement of the dream content; in the dream thoughtsonly the other portion of the speech played a part, because the dreamwork changed an imaginary situation into utter irrecognizability andcomplete inoffensiveness (while in a certain sense I behave in anunseemly way to the lady). The situation resulting in this phantasy is,however, nothing but a new edition of one that actually took place.2. A dream apparently meaningless relates to figures. _\"She wants to paysomething; her daughter takes three florins sixty-five kreuzers out ofher purse; but she says: \\'What are you doing? It only cost twenty-onekreuzers.\\'\"_The dreamer was a stranger who had placed her child at school in Vienna,and who was able to continue under my treatment so long as her daughterremained at Vienna. The day before the dream the directress of theschool had recommended her to keep the child another year at school. Inthis case she would have been able to prolong her treatment by one year.The figures in the dream become important if it be remembered that timeis money. One year equals 365 days, or, expressed in kreuzers, 365kreuzers, which is three florins sixty-five kreuzers. The twenty-onekreuzers correspond with the three weeks which remained from the day ofthe dream to the end of the school term, and thus to the end of thetreatment. It was obviously financial considerations which had moved thelady to refuse the proposal of the directress, and which were answerablefor the triviality of the amount in the dream.3. A lady, young, but already ten years married, heard that a friend ofhers, Miss Elise L----, of about the same age, had become engaged. Thisgave rise to the following dream:_She was sitting with her husband in the theater; the one side of thestalls was quite empty. Her husband tells her, Elise L---- and herfiancÃ© had intended coming, but could only get some cheap seats, threefor one florin fifty kreuzers, and these they would not take. In heropinion, that would not have mattered very much._The origin of the figures from the matter of the dream thoughts and thechanges the figures underwent are of interest. Whence came the oneflorin fifty kreuzers? From a trifling occurrence of the previous day.Her sister-in-law had received 150 florins as a present from herhusband, and had quickly got rid of it by buying some ornament. Notethat 150 florins is one hundred times one florin fifty kreuzers. For the_three_ concerned with the tickets, the only link is that Elise L---- isexactly three months younger than the dreamer. The scene in the dream isthe repetition of a little adventure for which she has often been teasedby her husband. She was once in a great hurry to get tickets in time fora piece, and when she came to the theater _one side of the stalls wasalmost empty_. It was therefore quite unnecessary for her to have beenin _such a hurry_. Nor must we overlook the absurdity of the dream thattwo persons should take three tickets for the theater.Now for the dream ideas. It was _stupid_ to have married so early; I_need not_ have been _in so great a hurry_. Elise L----\\'s example showsme that I should have been able to get a husband later; indeed, one a_hundred times better_ if I had but waited. I could have bought _three_such men with the money (dowry).[1] \"Ich mÃ¶chte gerne etwas geniessen ohne \\'Kosten\\' zu haben.\" A a punupon the word \"kosten,\" which has two meanings--\"taste\" and \"cost.\" In\"Die Traumdeutung,\" third edition, p. 71 footnote, Professor Freudremarks that \"the finest example of dream interpretation left us by theancients is based upon a pun\" (from \"The Interpretation of Dreams,\" byArtemidorus Daldianus). \"Moreover, dreams are so intimately bound upwith language that Ferenczi truly points out that every tongue has itsown language of dreams. A dream is as a rule untranslatable into otherlanguages.\"--TRANSLATOR.[2] It is worthy of remark that eminent philologists maintain that theoldest languages used the same word for expressing quite generalantitheses. In C. Abel\\'s essay, \"Ueber den Gegensinn der Urworter\"(1884, the following examples of such words in England are given:\"gleam--gloom\"; \"to lock--loch\"; \"down--The Downs\"; \"to step--to stop.\"In his essay on \"The Origin of Language\" (\"Linguistic Essays,\" p. 240),Abel says: \"When the Englishman says \\'without,\\' is not his judgmentbased upon the comparative juxtaposition of two opposites, \\'with\\' and\\'out\\'; \\'with\\' itself originally meant \\'without,\\' as may still be seen in\\'withdraw.\\' \\'Bid\\' includes the opposite sense of giving and ofproffering.\" Abel, \"The English Verbs of Command,\" \"Linguistic Essays,\"p. 104; see also Freud, \"Ueber den Gegensinn der Urworte\"; _Jahrbuch fÃ¼rPsychoanalytische und Psychopathologische Forschungen_, Band II., parti., p. 179).--TRANSLATOR.IIIWHY THE DREAM DISGUISES THE DESIRESIn the foregoing exposition we have now learnt something of the dreamwork; we must regard it as a quite special psychical process, which, sofar as we are aware, resembles nothing else. To the dream work has beentransferred that bewilderment which its product, the dream, has arousedin us. In truth, the dream work is only the first recognition of a groupof psychical processes to which must be referred the origin ofhysterical symptoms, the ideas of morbid dread, obsession, and illusion.Condensation, and especially displacement, are never-failing features inthese other processes. The regard for appearance remains, on the otherhand, peculiar to the dream work. If this explanation brings the dreaminto line with the formation of psychical disease, it becomes the moreimportant to fathom the essential conditions of processes like dreambuilding. It will be probably a surprise to hear that neither the stateof sleep nor illness is among the indispensable conditions. A wholenumber of phenomena of the everyday life of healthy persons,forgetfulness, slips in speaking and in holding things, together with acertain class of mistakes, are due to a psychical mechanism analogous tothat of the dream and the other members of this group.Displacement is the core of the problem, and the most striking of allthe dream performances. A thorough investigation of the subject showsthat the essential condition of displacement is purely psychological; itis in the nature of a motive. We get on the track by thrashing outexperiences which one cannot avoid in the analysis of dreams. I had tobreak off the relations of my dream thoughts in the analysis of my dreamon p. 8 because I found some experiences which I do not wish strangersto know, and which I could not relate without serious damage toimportant considerations. I added, it would be no use were I to selectanother instead of that particular dream; in every dream where thecontent is obscure or intricate, I should hit upon dream thoughts whichcall for secrecy. If, however, I continue the analysis for myself,without regard to those others, for whom, indeed, so personal an eventas my dream cannot matter, I arrive finally at ideas which surprise me,which I have not known to be mine, which not only appear _foreign_ tome, but which are _unpleasant_, and which I would like to opposevehemently, whilst the chain of ideas running through the analysisintrudes upon me inexorably. I can only take these circumstances intoaccount by admitting that these thoughts are actually part of mypsychical life, possessing a certain psychical intensity or energy.However, by virtue of a particular psychological condition, the_thoughts could not become conscious to me_. I call this particularcondition \"_Repression_.\" It is therefore impossible for me not torecognize some casual relationship between the obscurity of the dreamcontent and this state of repression--this _incapacity ofconsciousness_. Whence I conclude that the cause of the obscurity is_the desire to conceal these thoughts_. Thus I arrive at the conceptionof the _dream distortion_ as the deed of the dream work, and of_displacement_ serving to disguise this object.I will test this in my own dream, and ask myself, What is the thoughtwhich, quite innocuous in its distorted form, provokes my liveliestopposition in its real form? I remember that the free drive reminded meof the last expensive drive with a member of my family, theinterpretation of the dream being: I should for once like to experienceaffection for which I should not have to pay, and that shortly beforethe dream I had to make a heavy disbursement for this very person. Inthis connection, I cannot get away from the thought _that I regret thisdisbursement_. It is only when I acknowledge this feeling that there isany sense in my wishing in the dream for an affection that should entailno outlay. And yet I can state on my honor that I did not hesitate for amoment when it became necessary to expend that sum. The regret, thecounter-current, was unconscious to me. Why it was unconscious is quiteanother question which would lead us far away from the answer which,though within my knowledge, belongs elsewhere.If I subject the dream of another person instead of one of my own toanalysis, the result is the same; the motives for convincing others is,however, changed. In the dream of a healthy person the only way for meto enable him to accept this repressed idea is the coherence of thedream thoughts. He is at liberty to reject this explanation. But if weare dealing with a person suffering from any neurosis--say fromhysteria--the recognition of these repressed ideas is compulsory byreason of their connection with the symptoms of his illness and of theimprovement resulting from exchanging the symptoms for the repressedideas. Take the patient from whom I got the last dream about the threetickets for one florin fifty kreuzers. Analysis shows that she does notthink highly of her husband, that she regrets having married him, thatshe would be glad to change him for some one else. It is true that shemaintains that she loves her husband, that her emotional life knowsnothing about this depreciation (a hundred times better!), but all hersymptoms lead to the same conclusion as this dream. When her repressedmemories had rewakened a certain period when she was conscious that shedid not love her husband, her symptoms disappeared, and therewithdisappeared her resistance to the interpretation of the dream.This conception of repression once fixed, together with the distortionof the dream in relation to repressed psychical matter, we are in aposition to give a general exposition of the principal results which theanalysis of dreams supplies. We learnt that the most intelligible andmeaningful dreams are unrealized desires; the desires they pictured asrealized are known to consciousness, have been held over from thedaytime, and are of absorbing interest. The analysis of obscure andintricate dreams discloses something very similar; the dream scene againpictures as realized some desire which regularly proceeds from the dreamideas, but the picture is unrecognizable, and is only cleared up in theanalysis. The desire itself is either one repressed, foreign toconsciousness, or it is closely bound up with repressed ideas. Theformula for these dreams may be thus stated: _They are concealedrealizations of repressed desires_. It is interesting to note that theyare right who regard the dream as foretelling the future. Although thefuture which the dream shows us is not that which will occur, but thatwhich we would like to occur. Folk psychology proceeds here according toits wont; it believes what it wishes to believe.Dreams can be divided into three classes according to their relationtowards the realization of desire. Firstly come those which exhibit a_non-repressed, non-concealed desire_; these are dreams of the infantiletype, becoming ever rarer among adults. Secondly, dreams which expressin _veiled_ form some _repressed desire_; these constitute by far thelarger number of our dreams, and they require analysis for theirunderstanding. Thirdly, these dreams where repression exists, but_without_ or with but slight concealment. These dreams are invariablyaccompanied by a feeling of dread which brings the dream to an end. Thisfeeling of dread here replaces dream displacement; I regarded the dreamwork as having prevented this in the dream of the second class. It isnot very difficult to prove that what is now present as intense dread inthe dream was once desire, and is now secondary to the repression.There are also definite dreams with a painful content, without thepresence of any anxiety in the dream. These cannot be reckoned amongdreams of dread; they have, however, always been used to prove theunimportance and the psychical futility of dreams. An analysis of suchan example will show that it belongs to our second class of dreams--a_perfectly concealed_ realization of repressed desires. Analysis willdemonstrate at the same time how excellently adapted is the work ofdisplacement to the concealment of desires.A girl dreamt that she saw lying dead before her the only survivingchild of her sister amid the same surroundings as a few years before shesaw the first child lying dead. She was not sensible of any pain, butnaturally combatted the view that the scene represented a desire ofhers. Nor was that view necessary. Years ago it was at the funeral ofthe child that she had last seen and spoken to the man she loved. Werethe second child to die, she would be sure to meet this man again in hersister\\'s house. She is longing to meet him, but struggles against thisfeeling. The day of the dream she had taken a ticket for a lecture,which announced the presence of the man she always loved. The dream issimply a dream of impatience common to those which happen before ajourney, theater, or simply anticipated pleasures. The longing isconcealed by the shifting of the scene to the occasion when any joyousfeeling were out of place, and yet where it did once exist. Note,further, that the emotional behavior in the dream is adapted, not to thedisplaced, but to the real but suppressed dream ideas. The sceneanticipates the long-hoped-for meeting; there is here no call forpainful emotions.There has hitherto been no occasion for philosophers to bestirthemselves with a psychology of repression. We must be allowed toconstruct some clear conception as to the origin of dreams as the firststeps in this unknown territory. The scheme which we have formulated notonly from a study of dreams is, it is true, already somewhatcomplicated, but we cannot find any simpler one that will suffice. Wehold that our psychical apparatus contains two procedures for theconstruction of thoughts. The second one has the advantage that itsproducts find an open path to consciousness, whilst the activity of thefirst procedure is unknown to itself, and can only arrive atconsciousness through the second one. At the borderland of these twoprocedures, where the first passes over into the second, a censorshipis established which only passes what pleases it, keeping backeverything else. That which is rejected by the censorship is, accordingto our definition, in a state of repression. Under certain conditions,one of which is the sleeping state, the balance of power between the twoprocedures is so changed that what is repressed can no longer be keptback. In the sleeping state this may possibly occur through thenegligence of the censor; what has been hitherto repressed will nowsucceed in finding its way to consciousness. But as the censorship isnever absent, but merely off guard, certain alterations must be concededso as to placate it. It is a compromise which becomes conscious in thiscase--a compromise between what one procedure has in view and thedemands of the other. _Repression, laxity of the censor,compromise_--this is the foundation for the origin of many anotherpsychological process, just as it is for the dream. In such compromiseswe can observe the processes of condensation, of displacement, theacceptance of superficial associations, which we have found in the dreamwork.It is not for us to deny the demonic element which has played a part inconstructing our explanation of dream work. The impression left is thatthe formation of obscure dreams proceeds as if a person had somethingto say which must be agreeable for another person upon whom he isdependent to hear. It is by the use of this image that we figure toourselves the conception of the _dream distortion_ and of thecensorship, and ventured to crystallize our impression in a rathercrude, but at least definite, psychological theory. Whatever explanationthe future may offer of these first and second procedures, we shallexpect a confirmation of our correlate that the second procedurecommands the entrance to consciousness, and can exclude the first fromconsciousness.Once the sleeping state overcome, the censorship resumes complete sway,and is now able to revoke that which was granted in a moment ofweakness. That the _forgetting_ of dreams explains this in part, atleast, we are convinced by our experience, confirmed again and again.During the relation of a dream, or during analysis of one, it notinfrequently happens that some fragment of the dream is suddenlyforgotten. This fragment so forgotten invariably contains the best andreadiest approach to an understanding of the dream. Probably that is whyit sinks into oblivion--_i.e._, into a renewed suppression.Viewing the dream content as the representation of a realized desire,and referring its vagueness to the changes made by the censor in therepressed matter, it is no longer difficult to grasp the function ofdreams. In fundamental contrast with those saws which assume that sleepis disturbed by dreams, we hold the _dream as the guardian of sleep_. Sofar as children\\'s dreams are concerned, our view should find readyacceptance.The sleeping state or the psychical change to sleep, whatsoever it be,is brought about by the child being sent to sleep or compelled theretoby fatigue, only assisted by the removal of all stimuli which might openother objects to the psychical apparatus. The means which serve to keepexternal stimuli distant are known; but what are the means we can employto depress the internal psychical stimuli which frustrate sleep? Look ata mother getting her child to sleep. The child is full of beseeching; hewants another kiss; he wants to play yet awhile. His requirements are inpart met, in part drastically put off till the following day. Clearlythese desires and needs, which agitate him, are hindrances to sleep.Every one knows the charming story of the bad boy (Baldwin Groller\\'s)who awoke at night bellowing out, \"_I want the rhinoceros_.\" A reallygood boy, instead of bellowing, would have _dreamt_ that he was playingwith the rhinoceros. Because the dream which realizes his desire isbelieved during sleep, it removes the desire and makes sleep possible.It cannot be denied that this belief accords with the dream image,because it is arrayed in the psychical appearance of probability; thechild is without the capacity which it will acquire later to distinguishhallucinations or phantasies from reality.The adult has learnt this differentiation; he has also learnt thefutility of desire, and by continuous practice manages to postpone hisaspirations, until they can be granted in some roundabout method by achange in the external world. For this reason it is rare for him to havehis wishes realized during sleep in the short psychical way. It is evenpossible that this never happens, and that everything which appears tous like a child\\'s dream demands a much more elaborate explanation. Thusit is that for adults--for every sane person without exception--adifferentiation of the psychical matter has been fashioned which thechild knew not. A psychical procedure has been reached which, informedby the experience of life, exercises with jealous power a dominating andrestraining influence upon psychical emotions; by its relation toconsciousness, and by its spontaneous mobility, it is endowed with thegreatest means of psychical power. A portion of the infantile emotionshas been withheld from this procedure as useless to life, and all thethoughts which flow from these are found in the state of repression.Whilst the procedure in which we recognize our normal ego reposes uponthe desire for sleep, it appears compelled by the psycho-physiologicalconditions of sleep to abandon some of the energy with which it was wontduring the day to keep down what was repressed. This neglect is reallyharmless; however much the emotions of the child\\'s spirit may bestirred, they find the approach to consciousness rendered difficult, andthat to movement blocked in consequence of the state of sleep. Thedanger of their disturbing sleep must, however, be avoided. Moreover, wemust admit that even in deep sleep some amount of free attention isexerted as a protection against sense-stimuli which might, perchance,make an awakening seem wiser than the continuance of sleep. Otherwise wecould not explain the fact of our being always awakened by stimuli ofcertain quality. As the old physiologist Burdach pointed out, the motheris awakened by the whimpering of her child, the miller by the cessationof his mill, most people by gently calling out their names. Thisattention, thus on the alert, makes use of the internal stimuli arisingfrom repressed desires, and fuses them into the dream, which as acompromise satisfies both procedures at the same time. The dream createsa form of psychical release for the wish which is either suppressed orformed by the aid of repression, inasmuch as it presents it as realized.The other procedure is also satisfied, since the continuance of thesleep is assured. Our ego here gladly behaves like a child; it makes thedream pictures believable, saying, as it were, \"Quite right, but let mesleep.\" The contempt which, once awakened, we bear the dream, and whichrests upon the absurdity and apparent illogicality of the dream, isprobably nothing but the reasoning of our sleeping ego on the feelingsabout what was repressed; with greater right it should rest upon theincompetency of this disturber of our sleep. In sleep we are now andthen aware of this contempt; the dream content transcends the censorshiprather too much, we think, \"It\\'s only a dream,\" and sleep on.It is no objection to this view if there are borderlines for the dreamwhere its function, to preserve sleep from interruption, can no longerbe maintained--as in the dreams of impending dread. It is here changedfor another function--to suspend the sleep at the proper time. It actslike a conscientious night-watchman, who first does his duty by quellingdisturbances so as not to waken the citizen, but equally does his dutyquite properly when he awakens the street should the causes of thetrouble seem to him serious and himself unable to cope with them alone.This function of dreams becomes especially well marked when there arisessome incentive for the sense perception. That the senses aroused duringsleep influence the dream is well known, and can be experimentallyverified; it is one of the certain but much overestimated results of themedical investigation of dreams. Hitherto there has been an insolubleriddle connected with this discovery. The stimulus to the sense by whichthe investigator affects the sleeper is not properly recognized in thedream, but is intermingled with a number of indefinite interpretations,whose determination appears left to psychical free-will. There is, ofcourse, no such psychical free-will. To an external sense-stimulus thesleeper can react in many ways. Either he awakens or he succeeds insleeping on. In the latter case he can make use of the dream to dismissthe external stimulus, and this, again, in more ways than one. Forinstance, he can stay the stimulus by dreaming of a scene which isabsolutely intolerable to him. This was the means used by one who wastroubled by a painful perineal abscess. He dreamt that he was onhorseback, and made use of the poultice, which was intended toalleviate his pain, as a saddle, and thus got away from the cause of thetrouble. Or, as is more frequently the case, the external stimulusundergoes a new rendering, which leads him to connect it with arepressed desire seeking its realization, and robs him of its reality,and is treated as if it were a part of the psychical matter. Thus, someone dreamt that he had written a comedy which embodied a definite_motif_; it was being performed; the first act was over amidenthusiastic applause; there was great clapping. At this moment thedreamer must have succeeded in prolonging his sleep despite thedisturbance, for when he woke he no longer heard the noise; he concludedrightly that some one must have been beating a carpet or bed. The dreamswhich come with a loud noise just before waking have all attempted tocover the stimulus to waking by some other explanation, and thus toprolong the sleep for a little while.Whosoever has firmly accepted this _censorship_ as the chief motive forthe distortion of dreams will not be surprised to learn as the result ofdream interpretation that most of the dreams of adults are traced byanalysis to erotic desires. This assertion is not drawn from dreamsobviously of a sexual nature, which are known to all dreamers from theirown experience, and are the only ones usually described as \"sexualdreams.\" These dreams are ever sufficiently mysterious by reason of thechoice of persons who are made the objects of sex, the removal of allthe barriers which cry halt to the dreamer\\'s sexual needs in his wakingstate, the many strange reminders as to details of what are calledperversions. But analysis discovers that, in many other dreams in whosemanifest content nothing erotic can be found, the work of interpretationshows them up as, in reality, realization of sexual desires; whilst, onthe other hand, that much of the thought-making when awake, the thoughtssaved us as surplus from the day only, reaches presentation in dreamswith the help of repressed erotic desires.Towards the explanation of this statement, which is no theoreticalpostulate, it must be remembered that no other class of instincts hasrequired so vast a suppression at the behest of civilization as thesexual, whilst their mastery by the highest psychical processes are inmost persons soonest of all relinquished. Since we have learnt tounderstand _infantile sexuality_, often so vague in its expression, soinvariably overlooked and misunderstood, we are justified in saying thatnearly every civilized person has retained at some point or other theinfantile type of sex life; thus we understand that repressed infantilesex desires furnish the most frequent and most powerful impulses for theformation of dreams.[1]If the dream, which is the expression of some erotic desire, succeeds inmaking its manifest content appear innocently asexual, it is onlypossible in one way. The matter of these sexual presentations cannot beexhibited as such, but must be replaced by allusions, suggestions, andsimilar indirect means; differing from other cases of indirectpresentation, those used in dreams must be deprived of directunderstanding. The means of presentation which answer these requirementsare commonly termed \"symbols.\" A special interest has been directedtowards these, since it has been observed that the dreamers of the samelanguage use the like symbols--indeed, that in certain cases communityof symbol is greater than community of speech. Since the dreamers do notthemselves know the meaning of the symbols they use, it remains a puzzlewhence arises their relationship with what they replace and denote. Thefact itself is undoubted, and becomes of importance for the technique ofthe interpretation of dreams, since by the aid of a knowledge of thissymbolism it is possible to understand the meaning of the elements of adream, or parts of a dream, occasionally even the whole dream itself,without having to question the dreamer as to his own ideas. We thus comenear to the popular idea of an interpretation of dreams, and, on theother hand, possess again the technique of the ancients, among whom theinterpretation of dreams was identical with their explanation throughsymbolism.Though the study of dream symbolism is far removed from finality, we nowpossess a series of general statements and of particular observationswhich are quite certain. There are symbols which practically always havethe same meaning: Emperor and Empress (King and Queen) always mean theparents; room, a woman[2], and so on. The sexes are represented by agreat variety of symbols, many of which would be at first quiteincomprehensible had not the clews to the meaning been often obtainedthrough other channels.There are symbols of universal circulation, found in all dreamers, ofone range of speech and culture; there are others of the narrowestindividual significance which an individual has built up out of his ownmaterial. In the first class those can be differentiated whose claim canbe at once recognized by the replacement of sexual things in commonspeech (those, for instance, arising from agriculture, as reproduction,seed) from others whose sexual references appear to reach back to theearliest times and to the obscurest depths of our image-building. Thepower of building symbols in both these special forms of symbols has notdied out. Recently discovered things, like the airship, are at oncebrought into universal use as sex symbols.It would be quite an error to suppose that a profounder knowledge ofdream symbolism (the \"Language of Dreams\") would make us independent ofquestioning the dreamer regarding his impressions about the dream, andwould give us back the whole technique of ancient dream interpreters.Apart from individual symbols and the variations in the use of what isgeneral, one never knows whether an element in the dream is to beunderstood symbolically or in its proper meaning; the whole content ofthe dream is certainly not to be interpreted symbolically. The knowledgeof dream symbols will only help us in understanding portions of thedream content, and does not render the use of the technical rulespreviously given at all superfluous. But it must be of the greatestservice in interpreting a dream just when the impressions of the dreamerare withheld or are insufficient.Dream symbolism proves also indispensable for understanding theso-called \"typical\" dreams and the dreams that \"repeat themselves.\"Dream symbolism leads us far beyond the dream; it does not belong onlyto dreams, but is likewise dominant in legend, myth, and saga, in witand in folklore. It compels us to pursue the inner meaning of the dreamin these productions. But we must acknowledge that symbolism is not aresult of the dream work, but is a peculiarity probably of ourunconscious thinking, which furnishes to the dream work the matter forcondensation, displacement, and dramatization.[1] Freud, \"Three Contributions to Sexual Theory,\" translated by A.A.Brill (_Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease_ Publishing Company, NewYork).[2] The words from \"and\" to \"channels\" in the next sentence is a shortsummary of the passage in the original.

We shall not,however, follow this track, but return to our original problem as soonas we have cleared up the subject of dream-disfigurement. The questionhas arisen how dreams with disagreeable content can be analyzed as thefulfillment of wishes. We see now that this is possible in casedream-disfigurement has taken place, in case the disagreeable contentserves only as a disguise for what is wished. Keeping in mind ourassumptions in regard to the two psychic instances, we may now proceedto say: disagreeable dreams, as a matter of fact, contain somethingwhich is disagreeable to the second instance, but which at the same timefulfills a wish of the first instance. They are wish dreams in the sensethat every dream originates in the first instance, while the secondinstance acts towards the dream only in repelling, not in a creativemanner. If we limit ourselves to a consideration of what the secondinstance contributes to the dream, we can never understand the dream. Ifwe do so, all the riddles which the authors have found in the dreamremain unsolved.That the dream actually has a secret meaning, which turns out to be thefulfillment of a wish, must be proved afresh for every case by means ofan analysis. I therefore select several dreams which have painfulcontents and attempt an analysis of them. They are partly dreams ofhysterical subjects, which require long preliminary statements, and nowand then also an examination of the psychic processes which occur inhysteria. I cannot, however, avoid this added difficulty in theexposition.When I give a psychoneurotic patient analytical treatment, dreams arealways, as I have said, the subject of our discussion. It must,therefore, give him all the psychological explanations through whose aidI myself have come to an understanding of his symptoms, and here Iundergo an unsparing criticism, which is perhaps not less keen than thatI must expect from my colleagues. Contradiction of the thesis that alldreams are the fulfillments of wishes is raised by my patients withperfect regularity. Here are several examples of the dream materialwhich is offered me to refute this position.\"You always tell me that the dream is a wish fulfilled,\" begins a cleverlady patient. \"Now I shall tell you a dream in which the content isquite the opposite, in which a wish of mine is _not_ fulfilled. How doyou reconcile that with your theory? The dream is as follows:--_\"I want to give a supper, but having nothing at hand except some smokedsalmon, I think of going marketing, but I remember that it is Sundayafternoon, when all the shops are closed. I next try to telephone tosome caterers, but the telephone is out of order.... Thus I must resignmy wish to give a supper.\"_I answer, of course, that only the analysis can decide the meaning ofthis dream, although I admit that at first sight it seems sensible andcoherent, and looks like the opposite of a wish-fulfillment. \"But whatoccurrence has given rise to this dream?\" I ask. \"You know that thestimulus for a dream always lies among the experiences of the precedingday.\"_Analysis._--The husband of the patient, an upright and conscientiouswholesale butcher, had told her the day before that he is growing toofat, and that he must, therefore, begin treatment for obesity. He wasgoing to get up early, take exercise, keep to a strict diet, and aboveall accept no more invitations to suppers. She proceeds laughingly torelate how her husband at an inn table had made the acquaintance of anartist, who insisted upon painting his portrait because he, the painter,had never found such an expressive head. But her husband had answered inhis rough way, that he was very thankful for the honor, but that he wasquite convinced that a portion of the backside of a pretty young girlwould please the artist better than his whole face[1]. She said that shewas at the time very much in love with her husband, and teased him agood deal. She had also asked him not to send her any caviare. What doesthat mean?As a matter of fact, she had wanted for a long time to eat a caviaresandwich every forenoon, but had grudged herself the expense. Of course,she would at once get the caviare from her husband, as soon as she askedhim for it. But she had begged him, on the contrary, not to send her thecaviare, in order that she might tease him about it longer.This explanation seems far-fetched to me. Unadmitted motives are in thehabit of hiding behind such unsatisfactory explanations. We are remindedof subjects hypnotized by Bernheim, who carried out a posthypnoticorder, and who, upon being asked for their motives, instead ofanswering: \"I do not know why I did that,\" had to invent a reason thatwas obviously inadequate. Something similar is probably the case withthe caviare of my patient. I see that she is compelled to create anunfulfilled wish in life. Her dream also shows the reproduction of thewish as accomplished. But why does she need an unfulfilled wish?The ideas so far produced are insufficient for the interpretation of thedream. I beg for more. After a short pause, which corresponds to theovercoming of a resistance, she reports further that the day before shehad made a visit to a friend, of whom she is really jealous, because herhusband is always praising this woman so much. Fortunately, this friendis very lean and thin, and her husband likes well-rounded figures. Nowof what did this lean friend speak? Naturally of her wish to becomesomewhat stouter. She also asked my patient: \"When are you going toinvite us again? You always have such a good table.\"Now the meaning of the dream is clear. I may say to the patient: \"It isjust as though you had thought at the time of the request: \\'Of course,I\\'ll invite you, so you can eat yourself fat at my house and becomestill more pleasing to my husband. I would rather give no more suppers.\\'The dream then tells you that you cannot give a supper, therebyfulfilling your wish not to contribute anything to the rounding out ofyour friend\\'s figure. The resolution of your husband to refuseinvitations to supper for the sake of getting thin teaches you that onegrows fat on the things served in company.\" Now only some conversationis necessary to confirm the solution. The smoked salmon in the dream hasnot yet been traced. \"How did the salmon mentioned in the dream occur toyou?\" \"Smoked salmon is the favorite dish of this friend,\" she answered.I happen to know the lady, and may corroborate this by saying that shegrudges herself the salmon just as much as my patient grudges herselfthe caviare.The dream admits of still another and more exact interpretation, whichis necessitated only by a subordinate circumstance. The twointerpretations do not contradict one another, but rather cover eachother and furnish a neat example of the usual ambiguity of dreams aswell as of all other psychopathological formations. We have seen that atthe same time that she dreams of the denial of the wish, the patient isin reality occupied in securing an unfulfilled wish (the caviaresandwiches). Her friend, too, had expressed a wish, namely, to getfatter, and it would not surprise us if our lady had dreamt that thewish of the friend was not being fulfilled. For it is her own wish thata wish of her friend\\'s--for increase in weight--should not be fulfilled.Instead of this, however, she dreams that one of her own wishes is notfulfilled. The dream becomes capable of a new interpretation, if in thedream she does not intend herself, but her friend, if she has putherself in the place of her friend, or, as we may say, has identifiedherself with her friend.I think she has actually done this, and as a sign of this identificationshe has created an unfulfilled wish in reality. But what is the meaningof this hysterical identification? To clear this up a thoroughexposition is necessary. Identification is a highly important factor inthe mechanism of hysterical symptoms; by this means patients are enabledin their symptoms to represent not merely their own experiences, but theexperiences of a great number of other persons, and can suffer, as itwere, for a whole mass of people, and fill all the parts of a drama bymeans of their own personalities alone. It will here be objected thatthis is well-known hysterical imitation, the ability of hystericsubjects to copy all the symptoms which impress them when they occur inothers, as though their pity were stimulated to the point ofreproduction. But this only indicates the way in which the psychicprocess is discharged in hysterical imitation; the way in which apsychic act proceeds and the act itself are two different things. Thelatter is slightly more complicated than one is apt to imagine theimitation of hysterical subjects to be: it corresponds to an unconsciousconcluded process, as an example will show. The physician who has afemale patient with a particular kind of twitching, lodged in thecompany of other patients in the same room of the hospital, is notsurprised when some morning he learns that this peculiar hystericalattack has found imitations. He simply says to himself: The others haveseen her and have done likewise: that is psychic infection. Yes, butpsychic infection proceeds in somewhat the following manner: As a rule,patients know more about one another than the physician knows about eachof them, and they are concerned about each other when the visit of thedoctor is over. Some of them have an attack to-day: soon it is knownamong the rest that a letter from home, a return of lovesickness or thelike, is the cause of it. Their sympathy is aroused, and the followingsyllogism, which does not reach consciousness, is completed in them: \"Ifit is possible to have this kind of an attack from such causes, I toomay have this kind of an attack, for I have the same reasons.\" If thiswere a cycle capable of becoming conscious, it would perhaps expressitself in _fear_ of getting the same attack; but it takes place inanother psychic sphere, and, therefore, ends in the realization of thedreaded symptom. Identification is therefore not a simple imitation, buta sympathy based upon the same etiological claim; it expresses an \"asthough,\" and refers to some common quality which has remained in theunconscious.Identification is most often used in hysteria to express sexualcommunity. An hysterical woman identifies herself most readily--althoughnot exclusively--with persons with whom she has had sexual relations, orwho have sexual intercourse with the same persons as herself. Languagetakes such a conception into consideration: two lovers are \"one.\" In thehysterical phantasy, as well as in the dream, it is sufficient for theidentification if one thinks of sexual relations, whether or not theybecome real. The patient, then, only follows the rules of the hystericalthought processes when she gives expression to her jealousy of herfriend (which, moreover, she herself admits to be unjustified, in thatshe puts herself in her place and identifies herself with her bycreating a symptom--the denied wish). I might further clarify theprocess specifically as follows: She puts herself in the place of herfriend in the dream, because her friend has taken her own place relationto her husband, and because she would like to take her friend\\'s place inthe esteem of her husband[2].The contradiction to my theory of dreams in the case of another femalepatient, the most witty among all my dreamers, was solved in a simplermanner, although according to the scheme that the non-fulfillment of onewish signifies the fulfillment of another. I had one day explained toher that the dream is a wish of fulfillment. The next day she brought mea dream to the effect that she was traveling with her mother-in-law totheir common summer resort. Now I knew that she had struggled violentlyagainst spending the summer in the neighborhood of her mother-in-law. Ialso knew that she had luckily avoided her mother-in-law by renting anestate in a far-distant country resort. Now the dream reversed thiswished-for solution; was not this in the flattest contradiction to mytheory of wish-fulfillment in the dream? Certainly, it was onlynecessary to draw the inferences from this dream in order to get at itsinterpretation. According to this dream, I was in the wrong. _It wasthus her wish that I should be in the wrong, and this wish the dreamshowed her as fulfilled._ But the wish that I should be in the wrong,which was fulfilled in the theme of the country home, referred to a moreserious matter. At that time I had made up my mind, from the materialfurnished by her analysis, that something of significance for herillness must have occurred at a certain time in her life. She had deniedit because it was not present in her memory. We soon came to see that Iwas in the right. Her wish that I should be in the wrong, which istransformed into the dream, thus corresponded to the justifiable wishthat those things, which at the time had only been suspected, had neveroccurred at all.Without an analysis, and merely by means of an assumption, I took theliberty of interpreting a little occurrence in the case of a friend, whohad been my colleague through the eight classes of the Gymnasium. Heonce heard a lecture of mine delivered to a small assemblage, on thenovel subject of the dream as the fulfillment of a wish. He went home,dreamt _that he had lost all his suits_--he was a lawyer--and thencomplained to me about it. I took refuge in the evasion: \"One can\\'t winall one\\'s suits,\" but I thought to myself: \"If for eight years I sat asPrimus on the first bench, while he moved around somewhere in the middleof the class, may he not naturally have had a wish from his boyhood daysthat I, too, might for once completely disgrace myself?\"In the same way another dream of a more gloomy character was offered meby a female patient as a contradiction to my theory of the wish-dream.The patient, a young girl, began as follows: \"You remember that mysister has now only one boy, Charles: she lost the elder one, Otto,while I was still at her house. Otto was my favorite; it was I whoreally brought him up. I like the other little fellow, too, but ofcourse not nearly as much as the dead one. Now I dreamt last night that_I saw Charles lying dead before me. He was lying in his little coffin,his hands folded: there were candles all about, and, in short, it wasjust like the time of little Otto\\'s death, which shocked me soprofoundly_. Now tell me, what does this mean? You know me: am I reallybad enough to wish my sister to lose the only child she has left? Ordoes the dream mean that I wish Charles to be dead rather than Otto,whom I like so much better?\"I assured her that this interpretation was impossible. After somereflection I was able to give her the interpretation of the dream, whichI subsequently made her confirm.Having become an orphan at an early age, the girl had been brought up inthe house of a much older sister, and had met among the friends andvisitors who came to the house, a man who made a lasting impression uponher heart. It looked for a time as though these barely expressedrelations were to end in marriage, but this happy culmination wasfrustrated by the sister, whose motives have never found a completeexplanation. After the break, the man who was loved by our patientavoided the house: she herself became independent some time after littleOtto\\'s death, to whom her affection had now turned. But she did notsucceed in freeing herself from the inclination for her sister\\'s friendin which she had become involved. Her pride commanded her to avoid him;but it was impossible for her to transfer her love to the other suitorswho presented themselves in order. Whenever the man whom she loved, whowas a member of the literary profession, announced a lecture anywhere,she was sure to be found in the audience; she also seized every otheropportunity to see him from a distance unobserved by him. I rememberedthat on the day before she had told me that the Professor was going to acertain concert, and that she was also going there, in order to enjoythe sight of him. This was on the day of the dream; and the concert wasto take place on the day on which she told me the dream. I could noweasily see the correct interpretation, and I asked her whether she couldthink of any event which had happened after the death of little Otto.She answered immediately: \"Certainly; at that time the Professorreturned after a long absence, and I saw him once more beside the coffinof little Otto.\" It was exactly as I had expected. I interpreted thedream in the following manner: \"If now the other boy were to die, thesame thing would be repeated. You would spend the day with your sister,the Professor would surely come in order to offer condolence, and youwould see him again under the same circumstances as at that time. Thedream signifies nothing but this wish of yours to see him again, againstwhich you are fighting inwardly. I know that you are carrying the ticketfor to-day\\'s concert in your bag. Your dream is a dream of impatience;it has anticipated the meeting which is to take place to-day by severalhours.\"In order to disguise her wish she had obviously selected a situation inwhich wishes of that sort are commonly suppressed--a situation which isso filled with sorrow that love is not thought of. And yet, it is veryeasily probable that even in the actual situation at the bier of thesecond, more dearly loved boy, which the dream copied faithfully, shehad not been able to suppress her feelings of affection for the visitorwhom she had missed for so long a time.A different explanation was found in the case of a similar dream ofanother female patient, who was distinguished in her earlier years byher quick wit and her cheerful demeanors and who still showed thesequalities at least in the notion, which occurred to her in the course oftreatment. In connection with a longer dream, it seemed to this ladythat she saw her fifteen-year-old daughter lying dead before her in abox. She was strongly inclined to convert this dream-image into anobjection to the theory of wish-fulfillment, but herself suspected thatthe detail of the box must lead to a different conception of thedream.[3] In the course of the analysis it occurred to her that on theevening before, the conversation of the company had turned upon theEnglish word \"box,\" and upon the numerous translations of it intoGerman, such as box, theater box, chest, box on the ear, &c. From othercomponents of the same dream it is now possible to add that the lady hadguessed the relationship between the English word \"box\" and the German_BÃ¼chse_, and had then been haunted by the memory that _BÃ¼chse_ (as wellas \"box\") is used in vulgar speech to designate the female genitalorgan. It was therefore possible, making a certain allowance for hernotions on the subject of topographical anatomy, to assume that thechild in the box signified a child in the womb of the mother. At thisstage of the explanation she no longer denied that the picture of thedream really corresponded to one of her wishes. Like so many other youngwomen, she was by no means happy when she became pregnant, and admittedto me more than once the wish that her child might die before its birth;in a fit of anger following a violent scene with her husband she hadeven struck her abdomen with her fists in order to hit the child within.The dead child was, therefore, really the fulfillment of a wish, but awish which had been put aside for fifteen years, and it is notsurprising that the fulfillment of the wish was no longer recognizedafter so long an interval. For there had been many changes meanwhile.The group of dreams to which the two last mentioned belong, having ascontent the death of beloved relatives, will be considered again underthe head of \"Typical Dreams.\" I shall there be able to show by newexamples that in spite of their undesirable content, all these dreamsmust be interpreted as wish-fulfillments. For the following dream, whichagain was told me in order to deter me from a hasty generalization ofthe theory of wishing in dreams, I am indebted, not to a patient, but toan intelligent jurist of my acquaintance. \"_I dream_,\" my informanttells me, \"_that I am walking in front of my house with a lady on myarm. Here a closed wagon is waiting, a gentleman steps up to me, giveshis authority as an agent of the police, and demands that I shouldfollow him. I only ask for time in which to arrange my affairs._ Can youpossibly suppose this is a wish of mine to be arrested?\" \"Of coursenot,\" I must admit. \"Do you happen to know upon what charge you werearrested?\" \"Yes; I believe for infanticide.\" \"Infanticide? But you knowthat only a mother can commit this crime upon her newly born child?\"\"That is true.\"[4] \"And under what circumstances did you dream; whathappened on the evening before?\" \"I would rather not tell you that; itis a delicate matter.\" \"But I must have it, otherwise we must forgo theinterpretation of the dream.\" \"Well, then, I will tell you. I spent thenight, not at home, but at the house of a lady who means very much tome. When we awoke in the morning, something again passed between us.Then I went to sleep again, and dreamt what I have told you.\" \"The womanis married?\" \"Yes.\" \"And you do not wish her to conceive a child?\" \"No;that might betray us.\" \"Then you do not practice normal coitus?\" \"I takethe precaution to withdraw before ejaculation.\" \"Am I permitted toassume that you did this trick several times during the night, and thatin the morning you were not quite sure whether you had succeeded?\" \"Thatmight be the case.\" \"Then your dream is the fulfillment of a wish. Bymeans of it you secure the assurance that you have not begotten a child,or, what amounts to the same thing, that you have killed a child. I caneasily demonstrate the connecting links. Do you remember, a few days agowe were talking about the distress of matrimony (Ehenot), and about theinconsistency of permitting the practice of coitus as long as noimpregnation takes place, while every delinquency after the ovum andthe semen meet and a foetus is formed is punished as a crime? Inconnection with this, we also recalled the mediÃ¦val controversy aboutthe moment of time at which the soul is really lodged in the foetus,since the concept of murder becomes admissible only from that point on.Doubtless you also know the gruesome poem by Lenau, which putsinfanticide and the prevention of children on the same plane.\"\"Strangely enough, I had happened to think of Lenau during theafternoon.\" \"Another echo of your dream. And now I shall demonstrate toyou another subordinate wish-fulfillment in your dream. You walk infront of your house with the lady on your arm. So you take her home,instead of spending the night at her house, as you do in actuality. Thefact that the wish-fulfillment, which is the essence of the dream,disguises itself in such an unpleasant form, has perhaps more than onereason. From my essay on the etiology of anxiety neuroses, you will seethat I note interrupted coitus as one of the factors which cause thedevelopment of neurotic fear. It would be consistent with this that ifafter repeated cohabitation of the kind mentioned you should be left inan uncomfortable mood, which now becomes an element in the compositionof your dream. You also make use of this unpleasant state of mind toconceal the wish-fulfillment. Furthermore, the mention of infanticidehas not yet been explained. Why does this crime, which is peculiar tofemales, occur to you?\" \"I shall confess to you that I was involved insuch an affair years ago. Through my fault a girl tried to protectherself from the consequences of a _liaison_ with me by securing anabortion. I had nothing to do with carrying out the plan, but I wasnaturally for a long time worried lest the affair might be discovered.\"\"I understand; this recollection furnished a second reason why thesupposition that you had done your trick badly must have been painful toyou.\"A young physician, who had heard this dream of my colleague when it wastold, must have felt implicated by it, for he hastened to imitate it ina dream of his own, applying its mode of thinking to another subject.The day before he had handed in a declaration of his income, which wasperfectly honest, because he had little to declare. He dreamt that anacquaintance of his came from a meeting of the tax commission andinformed him that all the other declarations of income had passeduncontested, but that his own had awakened general suspicion, and thathe would be punished with a heavy fine. The dream is a poorly-concealedfulfillment of the wish to be known as a physician with a large income.It likewise recalls the story of the young girl who was advised againstaccepting her suitor because he was a man of quick temper who wouldsurely treat her to blows after they were married.The answer of the girl was: \"I wish he _would_ strike me!\" Her wish tobe married is so strong that she takes into the bargain the discomfortwhich is said to be connected with matrimony, and which is predicted forher, and even raises it to a wish.If I group the very frequently occurring dreams of this sort, which seemflatly to contradict my theory, in that they contain the denial of awish or some occurrence decidedly unwished for, under the head of\"counter wish-dreams,\" I observe that they may all be referred to twoprinciples, of which one has not yet been mentioned, although it plays alarge part in the dreams of human beings. One of the motives inspiringthese dreams is the wish that I should appear in the wrong. These dreamsregularly occur in the course of my treatment if the patient shows aresistance against me, and I can count with a large degree of certaintyupon causing such a dream after I have once explained to the patient mytheory that the dream is a wish-fulfillment.[5] I may even expect thisto be the case in a dream merely in order to fulfill the wish that I mayappear in the wrong. The last dream which I shall tell from thoseoccurring in the course of treatment again shows this very thing. Ayoung girl who has struggled hard to continue my treatment, against thewill of her relatives and the authorities whom she had consulted, dreamsas follows: _She is forbidden at home to come to me any more. She thenreminds me of the promise I made her to treat her for nothing ifnecessary, and I say to her: \"I can show no consideration in moneymatters.\"_It is not at all easy in this case to demonstrate the fulfillment of awish, but in all cases of this kind there is a second problem, thesolution of which helps also to solve the first. Where does she get thewords which she puts into my mouth? Of course I have never told heranything like that, but one of her brothers, the very one who has thegreatest influence over her, has been kind enough to make this remarkabout me. It is then the purpose of the dream that this brother shouldremain in the right; and she does not try to justify this brother merelyin the dream; it is her purpose in life and the motive for her beingill.The other motive for counter wish-dreams is so clear that there isdanger of overlooking it, as for some time happened in my own case. Inthe sexual make-up of many people there is a masochistic component,which has arisen through the conversion of the aggressive, sadisticcomponent into its opposite. Such people are called \"ideal\" masochists,if they seek pleasure not in the bodily pain which may be inflicted uponthem, but in humiliation and in chastisement of the soul. It is obviousthat such persons can have counter wish-dreams and disagreeable dreams,which, however, for them are nothing but wish-fulfillment, affordingsatisfaction for their masochistic inclinations. Here is such a dream. Ayoung man, who has in earlier years tormented his elder brother, towardswhom he was homosexually inclined, but who had undergone a completechange of character, has the following dream, which consists of threeparts: (1) _He is \"insulted\" by his brother._ (2) _Two adults arecaressing each other with homosexual intentions._ (3) _His brother hassold the enterprise whose management the young man reserved for his ownfuture._ He awakens from the last-mentioned dream with the mostunpleasant feelings, and yet it is a masochistic wish-dream, which mightbe translated: It would serve me quite right if my brother were to makethat sale against my interest, as a punishment for all the tormentswhich he has suffered at my hands.I hope that the above discussion and examples will suffice--untilfurther objection can be raised--to make it seem credible that evendreams with a painful content are to be analyzed as the fulfillments ofwishes. Nor will it seem a matter of chance that in the course ofinterpretation one always happens upon subjects of which one does notlike to speak or think. The disagreeable sensation which such dreamsarouse is simply identical with the antipathy which endeavors--usuallywith success--to restrain us from the treatment or discussion of suchsubjects, and which must be overcome by all of us, if, in spite of itsunpleasantness, we find it necessary to take the matter in hand. Butthis disagreeable sensation, which occurs also in dreams, does notpreclude the existence of a wish; every one has wishes which he wouldnot like to tell to others, which he does not want to admit even tohimself. We are, on other grounds, justified in connecting thedisagreeable character of all these dreams with the fact of dreamdisfigurement, and in concluding that these dreams are distorted, andthat the wish-fulfillment in them is disguised until recognition isimpossible for no other reason than that a repugnance, a will tosuppress, exists in relation to the subject-matter of the dream or inrelation to the wish which the dream creates. Dream disfigurement,then, turns out in reality to be an act of the censor. We shall takeinto consideration everything which the analysis of disagreeable dreamshas brought to light if we reword our formula as follows: _The dream isthe (disguised) fulfillment of a (suppressed, repressed) wish_.Now there still remain as a particular species of dreams with painfulcontent, dreams of anxiety, the inclusion of which under dreams ofwishing will find least acceptance with the uninitiated. But I cansettle the problem of anxiety dreams in very short order; for what theymay reveal is not a new aspect of the dream problem; it is a question intheir case of understanding neurotic anxiety in general. The fear whichwe experience in the dream is only seemingly explained by the dreamcontent. If we subject the content of the dream to analysis, we becomeaware that the dream fear is no more justified by the dream content thanthe fear in a phobia is justified by the idea upon which the phobiadepends. For example, it is true that it is possible to fall out of awindow, and that some care must be exercised when one is near a window,but it is inexplicable why the anxiety in the corresponding phobia is sogreat, and why it follows its victims to an extent so much greater thanis warranted by its origin. The same explanation, then, which applies tothe phobia applies also to the dream of anxiety. In both cases theanxiety is only superficially attached to the idea which accompanies itand comes from another source.On account of the intimate relation of dream fear to neurotic fear,discussion of the former obliges me to refer to the latter. In a littleessay on \"The Anxiety Neurosis,\"[6] I maintained that neurotic fear hasits origin in the sexual life, and corresponds to a libido which hasbeen turned away from its object and has not succeeded in being applied.From this formula, which has since proved its validity more and moreclearly, we may deduce the conclusion that the content of anxiety dreamsis of a sexual nature, the libido belonging to which content has beentransformed into fear.[1] To sit for the painter. Goethe: \"And if he has no backside, how canthe nobleman sit?\"[2] I myself regret the introduction of such passages from thepsychopathology of hysteria, which, because of their fragmentaryrepresentation and of being torn from all connection with the subject,cannot have a very enlightening influence. If these passages are capableof throwing light upon the intimate relations between the dream and thepsychoneuroses, they have served the purpose for which I have taken themup.[3] Something like the smoked salmon in the dream of the deferredsupper.[4] It often happens that a dream is told incompletely, and that arecollection of the omitted portions appear only in the course of theanalysis. These portions subsequently fitted in, regularly furnish thekey to the interpretation. _Cf._ below, about forgetting in dreams.[5] Similar \"counter wish-dreams\" have been repeatedly reported to mewithin the last few years by my pupils who thus reacted to their firstencounter with the \"wish theory of the dream.\"[6] See _Selected Papers on Hysteria and other Psychoneuroses_, p. 133,translated by A.A. Brill, _Journal of Nervous and Mental Diseases_,Monograph Series.VSEX IN DREAMSThe more one is occupied with the solution of dreams, the more willingone must become to acknowledge that the majority of the dreams of adultstreat of sexual material and give expression to erotic wishes. Only onewho really analyzes dreams, that is to say, who pushes forward fromtheir manifest content to the latent dream thoughts, can form an opinionon this subject--never the person who is satisfied with registering themanifest content (as, for example, NÃ¤cke in his works on sexual dreams).Let us recognize at once that this fact is not to be wondered at, butthat it is in complete harmony with the fundamental assumptions of dreamexplanation. No other impulse has had to undergo so much suppressionfrom the time of childhood as the sex impulse in its numerouscomponents, from no other impulse have survived so many and such intenseunconscious wishes, which now act in the sleeping state in such a manneras to produce dreams. In dream interpretation, this significance ofsexual complexes must never be forgotten, nor must they, of course, beexaggerated to the point of being considered exclusive.Of many dreams it can be ascertained by a careful interpretation thatthey are even to be taken bisexually, inasmuch as they result in anirrefutable secondary interpretation in which they realize homosexualfeelings--that is, feelings that are common to the normal sexualactivity of the dreaming person. But that all dreams are to beinterpreted bisexually, seems to me to be a generalization asindemonstrable as it is improbable, which I should not like to support.Above all I should not know how to dispose of the apparent fact thatthere are many dreams satisfying other than--in the widest sense--eroticneeds, as dreams of hunger, thirst, convenience, &c. Likewise thesimilar assertions \"that behind every dream one finds the deathsentence\" (Stekel), and that every dream shows \"a continuation from thefeminine to the masculine line\" (Adler), seem to me to proceed farbeyond what is admissible in the interpretation of dreams.We have already asserted elsewhere that dreams which are conspicuouslyinnocent invariably embody coarse erotic wishes, and we might confirmthis by means of numerous fresh examples. But many dreams which appearindifferent, and which would never be suspected of any particularsignificance, can be traced back, after analysis, to unmistakably sexualwish-feelings, which are often of an unexpected nature. For example,who would suspect a sexual wish in the following dream until theinterpretation had been worked out? The dreamer relates: _Between twostately palaces stands a little house, receding somewhat, whose doorsare closed. My wife leads me a little way along the street up to thelittle house, and pushes in the door, and then I slip quickly and easilyinto the interior of a courtyard that slants obliquely upwards._Any one who has had experience in the translating of dreams will, ofcourse, immediately perceive that penetrating into narrow spaces, andopening locked doors, belong to the commonest sexual symbolism, and willeasily find in this dream a representation of attempted coition frombehind (between the two stately buttocks of the female body). The narrowslanting passage is of course the vagina; the assistance attributed tothe wife of the dreamer requires the interpretation that in reality itis only consideration for the wife which is responsible for thedetention from such an attempt. Moreover, inquiry shows that on theprevious day a young girl had entered the household of the dreamer whohad pleased him, and who had given him the impression that she would notbe altogether opposed to an approach of this sort. The little housebetween the two palaces is taken from a reminiscence of the Hradschinin Prague, and thus points again to the girl who is a native of thatcity.If with my patients I emphasize the frequency of the Oedipus dream--ofhaving sexual intercourse with one\\'s mother--I get the answer: \"I cannotremember such a dream.\" Immediately afterwards, however, there arisesthe recollection of another disguised and indifferent dream, which hasbeen dreamed repeatedly by the patient, and the analysis shows it to bea dream of this same content--that is, another Oedipus dream. I canassure the reader that veiled dreams of sexual intercourse with themother are a great deal more frequent than open ones to the same effect.There are dreams about landscapes and localities in which emphasis isalways laid upon the assurance: \"I have been there before.\" In this casethe locality is always the genital organ of the mother; it can indeed beasserted with such certainty of no other locality that one \"has beenthere before.\"A large number of dreams, often full of fear, which are concerned withpassing through narrow spaces or with staying, in the water, are basedupon fancies about the embryonic life, about the sojourn in the mother\\'swomb, and about the act of birth. The following is the dream of a youngman who in his fancy has already while in embryo taken advantage of hisopportunity to spy upon an act of coition between his parents._\"He is in a deep shaft, in which there is a window, as in the SemmeringTunnel. At first he sees an empty landscape through this window, andthen he composes a picture into it, which is immediately at hand andwhich fills out the empty space. The picture represents a field which isbeing thoroughly harrowed by an implement, and the delightful air, theaccompanying idea of hard work, and the bluish-black clods of earth makea pleasant impression. He then goes on and sees a primary school opened... and he is surprised that so much attention is devoted in it to thesexual feelings of the child, which makes him think of me.\"_Here is a pretty water-dream of a female patient, which was turned toextraordinary account in the course of treatment._At her summer resort at the ... Lake, she hurls herself into the darkwater at a place where the pale moon is reflected in the water._Dreams of this sort are parturition dreams; their interpretation isaccomplished by reversing the fact reported in the manifest dreamcontent; thus, instead of \"throwing one\\'s self into the water,\" read\"coming out of the water,\" that is, \"being born.\" The place from whichone is born is recognized if one thinks of the bad sense of the French\"la lune.\" The pale moon thus becomes the white \"bottom\" (Popo), whichthe child soon recognizes as the place from which it came. Now what canbe the meaning of the patient\\'s wishing to be born at her summer resort?I asked the dreamer this, and she answered without hesitation: \"Hasn\\'tthe treatment made me as though I were born again?\" Thus the dreambecomes an invitation to continue the cure at this summer resort, thatis, to visit her there; perhaps it also contains a very bashful allusionto the wish to become a mother herself.[1]Another dream of parturition, with its interpretation, I take from thework of E. Jones. _\"She stood at the seashore watching a small boy, whoseemed to be hers, wading into the water. This he did till the watercovered him, and she could only see his head bobbing up and down nearthe surface. The scene then changed to the crowded hall of a hotel. Herhusband left her, and she \\'entered into conversation with\\' astranger.\"_ The second half of the dream was discovered in the analysisto represent a flight from her husband, and the entering into intimaterelations with a third person, behind whom was plainly indicated Mr.X.\\'s brother mentioned in a former dream. The first part of the dreamwas a fairly evident birth phantasy. In dreams as in mythology, thedelivery of a child _from_ the uterine waters is commonly presented bydistortion as the entry of the child _into_ water; among many others,the births of Adonis, Osiris, Moses, and Bacchus are well-knownillustrations of this. The bobbing up and down of the head in the waterat once recalled to the patient the sensation of quickening she hadexperienced in her only pregnancy. Thinking of the boy going into thewater induced a reverie in which she saw herself taking him out of thewater, carrying him into the nursery, washing him and dressing him, andinstalling him in her household.The second half of the dream, therefore, represents thoughts concerningthe elopement, which belonged to the first half of the underlying latentcontent; the first half of the dream corresponded with the second halfof the latent content, the birth phantasy. Besides this inversion inorder, further inversions took place in each half of the dream. In thefirst half the child _entered_ the water, and then his head bobbed; inthe underlying dream thoughts first the quickening occurred, and thenthe child left the water (a double inversion). In the second half herhusband left her; in the dream thoughts she left her husband.Another parturition dream is related by Abraham of a young woman lookingforward to her first confinement. From a place in the floor of the housea subterranean canal leads directly into the water (parturition path,amniotic liquor). She lifts up a trap in the floor, and thereimmediately appears a creature dressed in a brownish fur, which almostresembles a seal. This creature changes into the younger brother of thedreamer, to whom she has always stood in maternal relationship.Dreams of \"saving\" are connected with parturition dreams. To save,especially to save from the water, is equivalent to giving birth whendreamed by a woman; this sense is, however, modified when the dreamer isa man.Robbers, burglars at night, and ghosts, of which we are afraid beforegoing to bed, and which occasionally even disturb our sleep, originatein one and the same childish reminiscence. They are the nightly visitorswho have awakened the child to set it on the chamber so that it may notwet the bed, or have lifted the cover in order to see clearly how thechild is holding its hands while sleeping. I have been able to induce anexact recollection of the nocturnal visitor in the analysis of some ofthese anxiety dreams. The robbers were always the father, the ghostsmore probably corresponded to feminine persons with white night-gowns.When one has become familiar with the abundant use of symbolism for therepresentation of sexual material in dreams, one naturally raises thequestion whether there are not many of these symbols which appear onceand for all with a firmly established significance like the signs instenography; and one is tempted to compile a new dream-book according tothe cipher method. In this connection it may be remarked that thissymbolism does not belong peculiarly to the dream, but rather tounconscious thinking, particularly that of the masses, and it is to befound in greater perfection in the folklore, in the myths, legends, andmanners of speech, in the proverbial sayings, and in the currentwitticisms of a nation than in its dreams.The dream takes advantage of this symbolism in order to give a disguisedrepresentation to its latent thoughts. Among the symbols which are usedin this manner there are of course many which regularly, or almostregularly, mean the same thing. Only it is necessary to keep in mind thecurious plasticity of psychic material. Now and then a symbol in thedream content may have to be interpreted not symbolically, but accordingto its real meaning; at another time the dreamer, owing to a peculiarset of recollections, may create for himself the right to use anythingwhatever as a sexual symbol, though it is not ordinarily used in thatway. Nor are the most frequently used sexual symbols unambiguous everytime.After these limitations and reservations I may call attention to thefollowing: Emperor and Empress (King and Queen) in most cases reallyrepresent the parents of the dreamer; the dreamer himself or herself isthe prince or princess. All elongated objects, sticks, tree-trunks, andumbrellas (on account of the stretching-up which might be compared to anerection! all elongated and sharp weapons, knives, daggers, and pikes,are intended to represent the male member. A frequent, not veryintelligible, symbol for the same is a nail-file (on account of therubbing and scraping?). Little cases, boxes, caskets, closets, andstoves correspond to the female part. The symbolism of lock and key hasbeen very gracefully employed by Uhland in his song about the \"GrafenEberstein,\" to make a common smutty joke. The dream of walking through arow of rooms is a brothel or harem dream. Staircases, ladders, andflights of stairs, or climbing on these, either upwards or downwards,are symbolic representations of the sexual act. Smooth walls over whichone is climbing, faÃ§ades of houses upon which one is letting oneselfdown, frequently under great anxiety, correspond to the erect humanbody, and probably repeat in the dream reminiscences of the upwardclimbing of little children on their parents or foster parents. \"Smooth\"walls are men. Often in a dream of anxiety one is holding on firmly tosome projection from a house. Tables, set tables, and boards are women,perhaps on account of the opposition which does away with the bodilycontours. Since \"bed and board\" (_mensa et thorus_) constitute marriage,the former are often put for the latter in the dream, and as far aspracticable the sexual presentation complex is transposed to the eatingcomplex. Of articles of dress the woman\\'s hat may frequently bedefinitely interpreted as the male genital. In dreams of men one oftenfinds the cravat as a symbol for the penis; this indeed is not onlybecause cravats hang down long, and are characteristic of the man, butalso because one can select them at pleasure, a freedom which isprohibited by nature in the original of the symbol. Persons who make useof this symbol in the dream are very extravagant with cravats, andpossess regular collections of them. All complicated machines andapparatus in dream are very probably genitals, in the description ofwhich dream symbolism shows itself to be as tireless as the activity ofwit. Likewise many landscapes in dreams, especially with bridges or withwooded mountains, can be readily recognized as descriptions of thegenitals. Finally where one finds incomprehensible neologisms one maythink of combinations made up of components having a sexualsignificance. Children also in the dream often signify the genitals, asmen and women are in the habit of fondly referring to their genitalorgan as their \"little one.\" As a very recent symbol of the male genitalmay be mentioned the flying machine, utilization of which is justifiedby its relation to flying as well as occasionally by its form. To playwith a little child or to beat a little one is often the dream\\'srepresentation of onanism. A number of other symbols, in part notsufficiently verified are given by Stekel, who illustrates them withexamples. Right and left, according to him, are to be conceived in thedream in an ethical sense. \"The right way always signifies the road torighteousness, the left the one to crime. Thus the left may signifyhomosexuality, incest, and perversion, while the right signifiesmarriage, relations with a prostitute, &c. The meaning is alwaysdetermined by the individual moral view-point of the dreamer.\" Relativesin the dream generally play the rÃ´le of genitals. Not to be able tocatch up with a wagon is interpreted by Stekel as regret not to be ableto come up to a difference in age. Baggage with which one travels is theburden of sin by which one is oppressed. Also numbers, which frequentlyoccur in the dream, are assigned by Stekel a fixed symbolical meaning,but these interpretations seem neither sufficiently verified nor ofgeneral validity, although the interpretation in individual cases cangenerally be recognized as probable. In a recently published book by W.Stekel, _Die Sprache des Traumes_, which I was unable to utilize, thereis a list of the most common sexual symbols, the object of which is toprove that all sexual symbols can be bisexually used. He states: \"Isthere a symbol which (if in any way permitted by the phantasy) may notbe used simultaneously in the masculine and the feminine sense!\" To besure the clause in parentheses takes away much of the absoluteness ofthis assertion, for this is not at all permitted by the phantasy. I donot, however, think it superfluous to state that in my experienceStekel\\'s general statement has to give way to the recognition of agreater manifoldness. Besides those symbols, which are just as frequentfor the male as for the female genitals, there are others whichpreponderately, or almost exclusively, designate one of the sexes, andthere are still others of which only the male or only the femalesignification is known. To use long, firm objects and weapons as symbolsof the female genitals, or hollow objects (chests, pouches, &c.), assymbols of the male genitals, is indeed not allowed by the fancy.It is true that the tendency of the dream and the unconscious fancy toutilize the sexual symbol bisexually betrays an archaic trend, for inchildhood a difference in the genitals is unknown, and the same genitalsare attributed to both sexes.These very incomplete suggestions may suffice to stimulate others tomake a more careful collection.I shall now add a few examples of the application of such symbolisms indreams, which will serve to show how impossible it becomes to interpreta dream without taking into account the symbolism of dreams, and howimperatively it obtrudes itself in many cases.1. The hat as a symbol of the man (of the male genital): (a fragmentfrom the dream of a young woman who suffered from agoraphobia on accountof a fear of temptation).\"I am walking in the street in summer, I wear a straw hat of peculiarshape, the middle piece of which is bent upwards and the side pieces ofwhich hang downwards (the description became here obstructed), and insuch a fashion that one is lower than the other. I am cheerful and in aconfidential mood, and as I pass a troop of young officers I think tomyself: None of you can have any designs upon me.\"As she could produce no associations to the hat, I said to her: \"The hatis really a male genital, with its raised middle piece and the twodownward hanging side pieces.\" I intentionally refrained frominterpreting those details concerning the unequal downward hanging ofthe two side pieces, although just such individualities in thedeterminations lead the way to the interpretation. I continued by sayingthat if she only had a man with such a virile genital she would not haveto fear the officers--that is, she would have nothing to wish from them,for she is mainly kept from going without protection and company by herfancies of temptation. This last explanation of her fear I had alreadybeen able to give her repeatedly on the basis of other material.It is quite remarkable how the dreamer behaved after thisinterpretation. She withdrew her description of the hat, and claimed notto have said that the two side pieces were hanging downwards. I was,however, too sure of what I had heard to allow myself to be misled, andI persisted in it. She was quiet for a while, and then found the courageto ask why it was that one of her husband\\'s testicles was lower than theother, and whether it was the same in all men. With this the peculiardetail of the hat was explained, and the whole interpretation wasaccepted by her. The hat symbol was familiar to me long before thepatient related this dream. From other but less transparent cases Ibelieve that the hat may also be taken as a female genital.2. The little one as the genital--to be run over as a symbol of sexualintercourse (another dream of the same agoraphobic patient).\"Her mother sends away her little daughter so that she must go alone.She rides with her mother to the railroad and sees her little onewalking directly upon the tracks, so that she cannot avoid being runover. She hears the bones crackle. (From this she experiences a feelingof discomfort but no real horror.) She then looks out through the carwindow to see whether the parts cannot be seen behind. She thenreproaches her mother for allowing the little one to go out alone.\"Analysis. It is not an easy matter to give here a completeinterpretation of the dream. It forms part of a cycle of dreams, and canbe fully understood only in connection with the others. For it is noteasy to get the necessary material sufficiently isolated to prove thesymbolism. The patient at first finds that the railroad journey is to beinterpreted historically as an allusion to a departure from a sanatoriumfor nervous diseases, with the superintendent of which she naturally wasin love. Her mother took her away from this place, and the physiciancame to the railroad station and handed her a bouquet of flowers onleaving; she felt uncomfortable because her mother witnessed thishomage. Here the mother, therefore, appears as a disturber of her loveaffairs, which is the rÃ´le actually played by this strict woman duringher daughter\\'s girlhood. The next thought referred to the sentence: \"Shethen looks to see whether the parts can be seen behind.\" In the dreamfaÃ§ade one would naturally be compelled to think of the parts of thelittle daughter run over and ground up. The thought, however, turns inquite a different direction. She recalls that she once saw her father inthe bath-room naked from behind; she then begins to talk about the sexdifferentiation, and asserts that in the man the genitals can be seenfrom behind, but in the woman they cannot. In this connection she nowherself offers the interpretation that the little one is the genital,her little one (she has a four-year-old daughter) her own genital. Shereproaches her mother for wanting her to live as though she had nogenital, and recognizes this reproach in the introductory sentence ofthe dream; the mother sends away her little one so that she must goalone. In her phantasy going alone on the street signifies to have noman and no sexual relations (coire = to go together), and this she doesnot like. According to all her statements she really suffered as a girlon account of the jealousy of her mother, because she showed apreference for her father.The \"little one\" has been noted as a symbol for the male or the femalegenitals by Stekel, who can refer in this connection to a verywidespread usage of language.The deeper interpretation of this dream depends upon another dream ofthe same night in which the dreamer identifies herself with her brother.She was a \"tomboy,\" and was always being told that she should have beenborn a boy. This identification with the brother shows with specialclearness that \"the little one\" signifies the genital. The motherthreatened him (her) with castration, which could only be understood asa punishment for playing with the parts, and the identification,therefore, shows that she herself had masturbated as a child, thoughthis fact she now retained only in memory concerning her brother. Anearly knowledge of the male genital which she later lost she must haveacquired at that time according to the assertions of this second dream.Moreover the second dream points to the infantile sexual theory thatgirls originate from boys through castration. After I had told her ofthis childish belief, she at once confirmed it with an anecdote in whichthe boy asks the girl: \"Was it cut off?\" to which the girl replied, \"No,it\\'s always been so.\"The sending away of the little one, of the genital, in the first dreamtherefore also refers to the threatened castration. Finally she blamesher mother for not having been born a boy.That \"being run over\" symbolizes sexual intercourse would not be evidentfrom this dream if we were not sure of it from many other sources.3. Representation of the genital by structures, stairways, and shafts.(Dream of a young man inhibited by a father complex.)\"He is taking a walk with his father in a place which is surely thePrater, for the _Rotunda_ may be seen in front of which there is a smallfront structure to which is attached a captive balloon; the balloon,however, seems quite collapsed. His father asks him what this is allfor; he is surprised at it, but he explains it to his father. They comeinto a court in which lies a large sheet of tin. His father wants topull off a big piece of this, but first looks around to see if any oneis watching. He tells his father that all he needs to do is to speak tothe watchman, and then he can take without any further difficulty asmuch as he wants to. From this court a stairway leads down into a shaft,the walls of which are softly upholstered something like a leatherpocketbook. At the end of this shaft there is a longer platform, andthen a new shaft begins....\"Analysis. This dream belongs to a type of patient which is not favorablefrom a therapeutic point of view. They follow in the analysis withoutoffering any resistances whatever up to a certain point, but from thatpoint on they remain almost inaccessible. This dream he almost analyzedhimself. \"The Rotunda,\" he said, \"is my genital, the captive balloon infront is my penis, about the weakness of which I have worried.\" We must,however, interpret in greater detail; the Rotunda is the buttock whichis regularly associated by the child with the genital, the smaller frontstructure is the scrotum. In the dream his father asks him what this isall for--that is, he asks him about the purpose and arrangement of thegenitals. It is quite evident that this state of affairs should beturned around, and that he should be the questioner. As such aquestioning on the side of the father has never taken place in reality,we must conceive the dream thought as a wish, or take it conditionally,as follows: \"If I had only asked my father for sexual enlightenment.\"The continuation of this thought we shall soon find in another place.The court in which the tin sheet is spread out is not to be conceivedsymbolically in the first instance, but originates from his father\\'splace of business. For discretionary reasons I have inserted the tin foranother material in which the father deals, without, however, changinganything in the verbal expression of the dream. The dreamer had enteredhis father\\'s business, and had taken a terrible dislike to thequestionable practices upon which profit mainly depends. Hence thecontinuation of the above dream thought (\"if I had only asked him\")would be: \"He would have deceived me just as he does his customers.\" Forthe pulling off, which serves to represent commercial dishonesty, thedreamer himself gives a second explanation--namely, onanism. This is notonly entirely familiar to us, but agrees very well with the fact thatthe secrecy of onanism is expressed by its opposite (\"Why one can do itquite openly\"). It, moreover, agrees entirely with our expectations thatthe onanistic activity is again put off on the father, just as was thequestioning in the first scene of the dream. The shaft he at onceinterprets as the vagina by referring to the soft upholstering of thewalls. That the act of coition in the vagina is described as a goingdown instead of in the usual way as a going up, I have also found truein other instances[2].The details that at the end of the first shaft there is a longerplatform and then a new shaft, he himself explains biographically. Hehad for some time consorted with women sexually, but had then given itup because of inhibitions and now hopes to be able to take it up againwith the aid of the treatment. The dream, however, becomes indistincttoward the end, and to the experienced interpreter it becomes evidentthat in the second scene of the dream the influence of another subjecthas begun to assert itself; in this his father\\'s business and hisdishonest practices signify the first vagina represented as a shaft sothat one might think of a reference to the mother.4. The male genital symbolized by persons and the female by a landscape.(Dream of a woman of the lower class, whose husband is a policeman,reported by B. Dattner.)... Then some one broke into the house and anxiously called for apoliceman. But he went with two tramps by mutual consent into achurch,[3] to which led a great many stairs;[4] behind the church therewas a mountain,[5] on top of which a dense forest.[6] The policeman wasfurnished with a helmet, a gorget, and a cloak.[7] The two vagrants, whowent along with the policeman quite peaceably, had tied to their loinssack-like aprons.[8] A road led from the church to the mountain. Thisroad was overgrown on each side with grass and brushwood, which becamethicker and thicker as it reached the height of the mountain, where itspread out into quite a forest.5. A stairway dream.(Reported and interpreted by Otto Rank.)For the following transparent pollution dream, I am indebted to thesame colleague who furnished us with the dental-irritation dream.\"I am running down the stairway in the stair-house after a little girl,whom I wish to punish because she has done something to me. At thebottom of the stairs some one held the child for me. (A grown-up woman?)I grasp it, but do not know whether I have hit it, for I suddenly findmyself in the middle of the stairway where I practice coitus with thechild (in the air as it were). It is really no coitus, I only rub mygenital on her external genital, and in doing this I see it verydistinctly, as distinctly as I see her head which is lying sideways.During the sexual act I see hanging to the left and above me (also as ifin the air) two small pictures, landscapes, representing a house on agreen. On the smaller one my surname stood in the place where thepainter\\'s signature should be; it seemed to be intended for my birthdaypresent. A small sign hung in front of the pictures to the effect thatcheaper pictures could also be obtained. I then see myself veryindistinctly lying in bed, just as I had seen myself at the foot of thestairs, and I am awakened by a feeling of dampness which came from thepollution.\"Interpretation. The dreamer had been in a book-store on the evening ofthe day of the dream, where, while he was waiting, he examined somepictures which were exhibited, which represented motives similar to thedream pictures. He stepped nearer to a small picture which particularlytook his fancy in order to see the name of the artist, which, however,was quite unknown to him.Later in the same evening, in company, he heard about a Bohemianservant-girl who boasted that her illegitimate child \"was made on thestairs.\" The dreamer inquired about the details of this unusualoccurrence, and learned that the servant-girl went with her lover to thehome of her parents, where there was no opportunity for sexualrelations, and that the excited man performed the act on the stairs. Inwitty allusion to the mischievous expression used about wine-adulterers,the dreamer remarked, \"The child really grew on the cellar steps.\"These experiences of the day, which are quite prominent in the dreamcontent, were readily reproduced by the dreamer. But he just as readilyreproduced an old fragment of infantile recollection which was alsoutilized by the dream. The stair-house was the house in which he hadspent the greatest part of his childhood, and in which he had firstbecome acquainted with sexual problems. In this house he used, amongother things, to slide down the banister astride which caused him tobecome sexually excited. In the dream he also comes down the stairs veryrapidly--so rapidly that, according to his own distinct assertions, hehardly touched the individual stairs, but rather \"flew\" or \"slid down,\"as we used to say. Upon reference to this infantile experience, thebeginning of the dream seems to represent the factor of sexualexcitement. In the same house and in the adjacent residence the dreamerused to play pugnacious games with the neighboring children, in which hesatisfied himself just as he did in the dream.If one recalls from Freud\\'s investigation of sexual symbolism[9] that inthe dream stairs or climbing stairs almost regularly symbolizes coitus,the dream becomes clear. Its motive power as well as its effect, as isshown by the pollution, is of a purely libidinous nature. Sexualexcitement became aroused during the sleeping state (in the dream thisis represented by the rapid running or sliding down the stairs) and thesadistic thread in this is, on the basis of the pugnacious playing,indicated in the pursuing and overcoming of the child. The libidinousexcitement becomes enhanced and urges to sexual action (represented inthe dream by the grasping of the child and the conveyance of it to themiddle of the stairway). Up to this point the dream would be one ofpure, sexual symbolism, and obscure for the unpracticed dreaminterpreter. But this symbolic gratification, which would have insuredundisturbed sleep, was not sufficient for the powerful libidinousexcitement. The excitement leads to an orgasm, and thus the wholestairway symbolism is unmasked as a substitute for coitus. Freud laysstress on the rhythmical character of both actions as one of the reasonsfor the sexual utilization of the stairway symbolism, and this dreamespecially seems to corroborate this, for, according to the expressassertion of the dreamer, the rhythm of a sexual act was the mostpronounced feature in the whole dream.Still another remark concerning the two pictures, which, aside fromtheir real significance, also have the value of \"Weibsbilder\" (literally_woman-pictures_, but idiomatically _women_). This is at once shown bythe fact that the dream deals with a big and a little picture, just asthe dream content presents a big (grown up) and a little girl. Thatcheap pictures could also be obtained points to the prostitutioncomplex, just as the dreamer\\'s surname on the little picture and thethought that it was intended for his birthday, point to the parentcomplex (to be born on the stairway--to be conceived in coitus).The indistinct final scene, in which the dreamer sees himself on thestaircase landing lying in bed and feeling wet, seems to go back intochildhood even beyond the infantile onanism, and manifestly has itsprototype in similarly pleasurable scenes of bed-wetting.6. A modified stair-dream.To one of my very nervous patients, who was an abstainer, whose fancywas fixed on his mother, and who repeatedly dreamed of climbing stairsaccompanied by his mother, I once remarked that moderate masturbationwould be less harmful to him than enforced abstinence. This influenceprovoked the following dream:\"His piano teacher reproaches him for neglecting his piano-playing, andfor not practicing the _Etudes_ of Moscheles and Clementi\\'s _Gradus adParnassum_.\" In relation to this he remarked that the _Gradus_ is only astairway, and that the piano itself is only a stairway as it has ascale.It is correct to say that there is no series of associations whichcannot be adapted to the representation of sexual facts. I conclude withthe dream of a chemist, a young man, who has been trying to give up hishabit of masturbation by replacing it with intercourse with women._Preliminary statement._--On the day before the dream he had given astudent instruction concerning Grignard\\'s reaction, in which magnesiumis to be dissolved in absolutely pure ether under the catalyticinfluence of iodine. Two days before, there had been an explosion in thecourse of the same reaction, in which the investigator had burned hishand.Dream I. _He is to make phenylmagnesium-bromid; he sees the apparatuswith particular clearness, but he has substituted himself for themagnesium. He is now in a curious swaying attitude. He keeps repeatingto himself, \"This is the right thing, it is working, my feet arebeginning to dissolve and my knees are getting soft.\" Then he reachesdown and feels for his feet, and meanwhile (he does not know how) hetakes his legs out of the crucible, and then again he says to himself,\"That cannot be.... Yes, it must be so, it has been done correctly.\"Then he partially awakens, and repeats the dream to himself, because hewants to tell it to me. He is distinctly afraid of the analysis of thedream. He is much excited during this semi-sleeping state, and repeatscontinually, \"Phenyl, phenyl.\"_II. _He is in ... ing with his whole family; at half-past eleven. He isto be at the Schottenthor for a rendezvous with a certain lady, but hedoes not wake up until half-past eleven. He says to himself, \"It is toolate now; when you get there it will be half-past twelve.\" The nextinstant he sees the whole family gathered about the table--his motherand the servant girl with the soup-tureen with particular clearness.Then he says to himself, \"Well, if we are eating already, I certainlycan\\'t get away.\"_Analysis: He feels sure that even the first dream contains a referenceto the lady whom he is to meet at the rendezvous (the dream was dreamedduring the night before the expected meeting). The student to whom hegave the instruction is a particularly unpleasant fellow; he had said tothe chemist: \"That isn\\'t right,\" because the magnesium was stillunaffected, and the latter answered as though he did not care anythingabout it: \"It certainly isn\\'t right.\" He himself must be this student;he is as indifferent towards his analysis as the student is towards hissynthesis; the _He_ in the dream, however, who accomplishes theoperation, is myself. How unpleasant he must seem to me with hisindifference towards the success achieved!Moreover, he is the material with which the analysis (synthesis) ismade. For it is a question of the success of the treatment. The legs inthe dream recall an impression of the previous evening. He met a lady ata dancing lesson whom he wished to conquer; he pressed her to him soclosely that she once cried out. After he had stopped pressing againsther legs, he felt her firm responding pressure against his lower thighsas far as just above his knees, at the place mentioned in the dream. Inthis situation, then, the woman is the magnesium in the retort, which isat last working. He is feminine towards me, as he is masculine towardsthe woman. If it will work with the woman, the treatment will also work.Feeling and becoming aware of himself in the region of his knees refersto masturbation, and corresponds to his fatigue of the previous day....The rendezvous had actually been set for half-past eleven. His wish tooversleep and to remain with his usual sexual objects (that is, withmasturbation) corresponds with his resistance.[1] It is only of late that I have learned to value the significance offancies and unconscious thoughts about life in the womb. They containthe explanation of the curious fear felt by so many people of beingburied alive, as well as the profoundest unconscious reason for thebelief in a life after death which represents nothing but a projectioninto the future of this mysterious life before birth. _The act of birth,moreover, is the first experience with fear, and is thus the source andmodel of the emotion of fear._[2] Cf. _Zentralblatt fÃ¼r psychoanalyse_, I.[3] Or chapel--vagina.[4] Symbol of coitus.[5] Mons veneris.[6] Crines pubis.[7] Demons in cloaks and capucines are, according to the explanation ofa man versed in the subject, of a phallic nature.[8] The two halves of the scrotum.[9] See _Zentralblatt fÃ¼r Psychoanalyse_, vol. i., p. 2.VITHE WISH IN DREAMSThat the dream should be nothing but a wish-fulfillment surely seemedstrange to us all--and that not alone because of the contradictionsoffered by the anxiety dream.After learning from the first analytical explanations that the dreamconceals sense and psychic validity, we could hardly expect so simple adetermination of this sense. According to the correct but concisedefinition of Aristotle, the dream is a continuation of thinking insleep (in so far as one sleeps). Considering that during the day ourthoughts produce such a diversity of psychic acts--judgments,conclusions, contradictions, expectations, intentions, &c.--why shouldour sleeping thoughts be forced to confine themselves to the productionof wishes? Are there not, on the contrary, many dreams that present adifferent psychic act in dream form, _e.g._, a solicitude, and is notthe very transparent father\\'s dream mentioned above of just such anature? From the gleam of light falling into his eyes while asleep thefather draws the solicitous conclusion that a candle has been upset andmay have set fire to the corpse; he transforms this conclusion into adream by investing it with a senseful situation enacted in the presenttense. What part is played in this dream by the wish-fulfillment, andwhich are we to suspect--the predominance of the thought continued from,the waking state or of the thought incited by the new sensoryimpression?All these considerations are just, and force us to enter more deeplyinto the part played by the wish-fulfillment in the dream, and into thesignificance of the waking thoughts continued in sleep.It is in fact the wish-fulfillment that has already induced us toseparate dreams into two groups. We have found some dreams that wereplainly wish-fulfillments; and others in which wish-fulfillment couldnot be recognized, and was frequently concealed by every availablemeans. In this latter class of dreams we recognized the influence of thedream censor. The undisguised wish dreams were chiefly found inchildren, yet fleeting open-hearted wish dreams _seemed_ (I purposelyemphasize this word) to occur also in adults.We may now ask whence the wish fulfilled in the dream originates. But towhat opposition or to what diversity do we refer this \"whence\"? I thinkit is to the opposition between conscious daily life and a psychicactivity remaining unconscious which can only make itself noticeableduring the night. I thus find a threefold possibility for the origin ofa wish. Firstly, it may have been incited during the day, and owing toexternal circumstances failed to find gratification, there is thus leftfor the night an acknowledged but unfulfilled wish. Secondly, it maycome to the surface during the day but be rejected, leaving anunfulfilled but suppressed wish. Or, thirdly, it may have no relation todaily life, and belong to those wishes that originate during the nightfrom the suppression. If we now follow our scheme of the psychicapparatus, we can localize a wish of the first order in the systemForec. We may assume that a wish of the second order has been forcedback from the Forec. system into the Unc. system, where alone, ifanywhere, it can maintain itself; while a wish-feeling of the thirdorder we consider altogether incapable of leaving the Unc. system. Thisbrings up the question whether wishes arising from these differentsources possess the same value for the dream, and whether they have thesame power to incite a dream.On reviewing the dreams which we have at our disposal for answering thisquestion, we are at once moved to add as a fourth source of thedream-wish the actual wish incitements arising during the night, suchas thirst and sexual desire. It then becomes evident that the source ofthe dream-wish does not affect its capacity to incite a dream. That awish suppressed during the day asserts itself in the dream can be shownby a great many examples. I shall mention a very simple example of thisclass. A somewhat sarcastic young lady, whose younger friend has becomeengaged to be married, is asked throughout the day by her acquaintanceswhether she knows and what she thinks of the fiancÃ©. She answers withunqualified praise, thereby silencing her own judgment, as she wouldprefer to tell the truth, namely, that he is an ordinary person. Thefollowing night she dreams that the same question is put to her, andthat she replies with the formula: \"In case of subsequent orders it willsuffice to mention the number.\" Finally, we have learned from numerousanalyses that the wish in all dreams that have been subject todistortion has been derived from the unconscious, and has been unable tocome to perception in the waking state. Thus it would appear that allwishes are of the same value and force for the dream formation.I am at present unable to prove that the state of affairs is reallydifferent, but I am strongly inclined to assume a more stringentdetermination of the dream-wish. Children\\'s dreams leave no doubt thatan unfulfilled wish of the day may be the instigator of the dream. Butwe must not forget that it is, after all, the wish of a child, that itis a wish-feeling of infantile strength only. I have a strong doubtwhether an unfulfilled wish from the day would suffice to create a dreamin an adult. It would rather seem that as we learn to control ourimpulses by intellectual activity, we more and more reject as vain theformation or retention of such intense wishes as are natural tochildhood. In this, indeed, there may be individual variations; someretain the infantile type of psychic processes longer than others. Thedifferences are here the same as those found in the gradual decline ofthe originally distinct visual imagination.In general, however, I am of the opinion that unfulfilled wishes of theday are insufficient to produce a dream in adults. I readily admit thatthe wish instigators originating in conscious like contribute towardsthe incitement of dreams, but that is probably all. The dream would notoriginate if the foreconscious wish were not reinforced from anothersource.That source is the unconscious. I believe that _the conscious wish is adream inciter only if it succeeds in arousing a similar unconscious wishwhich reinforces it_. Following the suggestions obtained through thepsychoanalysis of the neuroses, I believe that these unconscious wishesare always active and ready for expression whenever they find anopportunity to unite themselves with an emotion from conscious life, andthat they transfer their greater intensity to the lesser intensity ofthe latter.[1] It may therefore seem that the conscious wish alone hasbeen realized in a dream; but a slight peculiarity in the formation ofthis dream will put us on the track of the powerful helper from theunconscious. These ever active and, as it were, immortal wishes from theunconscious recall the legendary Titans who from time immemorial haveborne the ponderous mountains which were once rolled upon them by thevictorious gods, and which even now quiver from time to time from theconvulsions of their mighty limbs; I say that these wishes found in therepression are of themselves of an infantile origin, as we have learnedfrom the psychological investigation of the neuroses. I should like,therefore, to withdraw the opinion previously expressed that it isunimportant whence the dream-wish originates, and replace it by another,as follows: _The wish manifested in the dream must be an infantile one_.In the adult it originates in the Unc., while in the child, where noseparation and censor as yet exist between Forec. and Unc., or wherethese are only in the process of formation, it is an unfulfilled andunrepressed wish from the waking state. I am aware that this conceptioncannot be generally demonstrated, but I maintain nevertheless that itcan be frequently demonstrated, even when it was not suspected, and thatit cannot be generally refuted.The wish-feelings which remain from the conscious waking state are,therefore, relegated to the background in the dream formation. In thedream content I shall attribute to them only the part attributed to thematerial of actual sensations during sleep. If I now take into accountthose other psychic instigations remaining from the waking state whichare not wishes, I shall only adhere to the line mapped out for me bythis train of thought. We may succeed in provisionally terminating thesum of energy of our waking thoughts by deciding to go to sleep. He is agood sleeper who can do this; Napoleon I. is reputed to have been amodel of this sort. But we do not always succeed in accomplishing it, orin accomplishing it perfectly. Unsolved problems, harassing cares,overwhelming impressions continue the thinking activity even duringsleep, maintaining psychic processes in the system which we have termedthe foreconscious. These mental processes continuing into sleep may bedivided into the following groups: 1, That which has not been terminatedduring the day owing to casual prevention; 2, that which has been leftunfinished by temporary paralysis of our mental power, _i.e._ theunsolved; 3, that which has been rejected and suppressed during the day.This unites with a powerful group (4) formed by that which has beenexcited in our Unc. during the day by the work of the foreconscious.Finally, we may add group (5) consisting of the indifferent and henceunsettled impressions of the day.We should not underrate the psychic intensities introduced into sleep bythese remnants of waking life, especially those emanating from the groupof the unsolved. These excitations surely continue to strive forexpression during the night, and we may assume with equal certainty thatthe sleeping state renders impossible the usual continuation of theexcitement in the foreconscious and the termination of the excitement byits becoming conscious. As far as we can normally become conscious ofour mental processes, even during the night, in so far we are notasleep. I shall not venture to state what change is produced in theForec. system by the sleeping state, but there is no doubt that thepsychological character of sleep is essentially due to the change ofenergy in this very system, which also dominates the approach tomotility, which is paralyzed during sleep. In contradistinction to this,there seems to be nothing in the psychology of the dream to warrant theassumption that sleep produces any but secondary changes in theconditions of the Unc. system. Hence, for the nocturnal excitation inthe Force, there remains no other path than that followed by the wishexcitements from the Unc. This excitation must seek reinforcement fromthe Unc., and follow the detours of the unconscious excitations. Butwhat is the relation of the foreconscious day remnants to the dream?There is no doubt that they penetrate abundantly into the dream, thatthey utilize the dream content to obtrude themselves upon consciousnesseven during the night; indeed, they occasionally even dominate the dreamcontent, and impel it to continue the work of the day; it is alsocertain that the day remnants may just as well have any other characteras that of wishes; but it is highly instructive and even decisive forthe theory of wish-fulfillment to see what conditions they must complywith in order to be received into the dream.Let us pick out one of the dreams cited above as examples, _e.g._, thedream in which my friend Otto seems to show the symptoms of Basedow\\'sdisease. My friend Otto\\'s appearance occasioned me some concern duringthe day, and this worry, like everything else referring to this person,affected me. I may also assume that these feelings followed me intosleep. I was probably bent on finding out what was the matter with him.In the night my worry found expression in the dream which I havereported, the content of which was not only senseless, but failed toshow any wish-fulfillment. But I began to investigate for the source ofthis incongruous expression of the solicitude felt during the day, andanalysis revealed the connection. I identified my friend Otto with acertain Baron L. and myself with a Professor R. There was only oneexplanation for my being impelled to select just this substitution forthe day thought. I must have always been prepared in the Unc. toidentify myself with Professor R., as it meant the realization of one ofthe immortal infantile wishes, viz. that of becoming great. Repulsiveideas respecting my friend, that would certainly have been repudiatedin a waking state, took advantage of the opportunity to creep into thedream, but the worry of the day likewise found some form of expressionthrough a substitution in the dream content. The day thought, which wasno wish in itself but rather a worry, had in some way to find aconnection with the infantile now unconscious and suppressed wish, whichthen allowed it, though already properly prepared, to \"originate\" forconsciousness. The more dominating this worry, the stronger must be theconnection to be established; between the contents of the wish and thatof the worry there need be no connection, nor was there one in any ofour examples.We can now sharply define the significance of the unconscious wish forthe dream. It may be admitted that there is a whole class of dreams inwhich the incitement originates preponderatingly or even exclusivelyfrom the remnants of daily life; and I believe that even my cherisheddesire to become at some future time a \"professor extraordinarius\" wouldhave allowed me to slumber undisturbed that night had not my worry aboutmy friend\\'s health been still active. But this worry alone would nothave produced a dream; the motive power needed by the dream had to becontributed by a wish, and it was the affair of the worriment toprocure for itself such wish as a motive power of the dream. To speakfiguratively, it is quite possible that a day thought plays the part ofthe contractor (_entrepreneur_) in the dream. But it is known that nomatter what idea the contractor may have in mind, and how desirous hemay be of putting it into operation, he can do nothing without capital;he must depend upon a capitalist to defray the necessary expenses, andthis capitalist, who supplies the psychic expenditure for the dream isinvariably and indisputably _a wish from the unconscious_, no matterwhat the nature of the waking thought may be.In other cases the capitalist himself is the contractor for the dream;this, indeed, seems to be the more usual case. An unconscious wish isproduced by the day\\'s work, which in turn creates the dream. The dreamprocesses, moreover, run parallel with all the other possibilities ofthe economic relationship used here as an illustration. Thus, theentrepreneur may contribute some capital himself, or severalentrepreneurs may seek the aid of the same capitalist, or severalcapitalists may jointly supply the capital required by the entrepreneur.Thus there are dreams produced by more than one dream-wish, and manysimilar variations which may readily be passed over and are of nofurther interest to us. What we have left unfinished in this discussionof the dream-wish we shall be able to develop later.The \"tertium comparationis\" in the comparisons just employed--_i.e._ thesum placed at our free disposal in proper allotment--admits of stillfiner application for the illustration of the dream structure. We canrecognize in most dreams a center especially supplied with perceptibleintensity. This is regularly the direct representation of thewish-fulfillment; for, if we undo the displacements of the dream-work bya process of retrogression, we find that the psychic intensity of theelements in the dream thoughts is replaced by the perceptible intensityof the elements in the dream content. The elements adjoining thewish-fulfillment have frequently nothing to do with its sense, but proveto be descendants of painful thoughts which oppose the wish. But, owingto their frequently artificial connection with the central element, theyhave acquired sufficient intensity to enable them to come to expression.Thus, the force of expression of the wish-fulfillment is diffused over acertain sphere of association, within which it raises to expression allelements, including those that are in themselves impotent. In dreamshaving several strong wishes we can readily separate from one anotherthe spheres of the individual wish-fulfillments; the gaps in the dreamlikewise can often be explained as boundary zones.Although the foregoing remarks have considerably limited thesignificance of the day remnants for the dream, it will nevertheless beworth our while to give them some attention. For they must be anecessary ingredient in the formation of the dream, inasmuch asexperience reveals the surprising fact that every dream shows in itscontent a connection with some impression of a recent day, often of themost indifferent kind. So far we have failed to see any necessity forthis addition to the dream mixture. This necessity appears only when wefollow closely the part played by the unconscious wish, and then seekinformation in the psychology of the neuroses. We thus learn that theunconscious idea, as such, is altogether incapable of entering into theforeconscious, and that it can exert an influence there only by unitingwith a harmless idea already belonging to the foreconscious, to which ittransfers its intensity and under which it allows itself to beconcealed. This is the fact of transference which furnishes anexplanation for so many surprising occurrences in the psychic life ofneurotics.The idea from the foreconscious which thus obtains an unmeritedabundance of intensity may be left unchanged by the transference, or itmay have forced upon it a modification from the content of thetransferring idea. I trust the reader will pardon my fondness forcomparisons from daily life, but I feel tempted to say that therelations existing for the repressed idea are similar to the situationsexisting in Austria for the American dentist, who is forbidden topractise unless he gets permission from a regular physician to use hisname on the public signboard and thus cover the legal requirements.Moreover, just as it is naturally not the busiest physicians who formsuch alliances with dental practitioners, so in the psychic life onlysuch foreconscious or conscious ideas are chosen to cover a repressedidea as have not themselves attracted much of the attention which isoperative in the foreconscious. The unconscious entangles with itsconnections preferentially either those impressions and ideas of theforeconscious which have been left unnoticed as indifferent, or thosethat have soon been deprived of this attention through rejection. It isa familiar fact from the association studies confirmed by everyexperience, that ideas which have formed intimate connections in onedirection assume an almost negative attitude to whole groups of newconnections. I once tried from this principle to develop a theory forhysterical paralysis.If we assume that the same need for the transference of the repressedideas which we have learned to know from the analysis of the neurosesmakes its influence felt in the dream as well, we can at once explaintwo riddles of the dream, viz. that every dream analysis shows aninterweaving of a recent impression, and that this recent element isfrequently of the most indifferent character. We may add what we havealready learned elsewhere, that these recent and indifferent elementscome so frequently into the dream content as a substitute for the mostdeep-lying of the dream thoughts, for the further reason that they haveleast to fear from the resisting censor. But while this freedom fromcensorship explains only the preference for trivial elements, theconstant presence of recent elements points to the fact that there is aneed for transference. Both groups of impressions satisfy the demand ofthe repression for material still free from associations, theindifferent ones because they have offered no inducement for extensiveassociations, and the recent ones because they have had insufficienttime to form such associations.We thus see that the day remnants, among which we may now include theindifferent impressions when they participate in the dream formation,not only borrow from the Unc. the motive power at the disposal of therepressed wish, but also offer to the unconscious somethingindispensable, namely, the attachment necessary to the transference. Ifwe here attempted to penetrate more deeply into the psychic processes,we should first have to throw more light on the play of emotions betweenthe foreconscious and the unconscious, to which, indeed, we are urged bythe study of the psychoneuroses, whereas the dream itself offers noassistance in this respect.Just one further remark about the day remnants. There is no doubt thatthey are the actual disturbers of sleep, and not the dream, which, onthe contrary, strives to guard sleep. But we shall return to this pointlater.We have so far discussed the dream-wish, we have traced it to the sphereof the Unc., and analyzed its relations to the day remnants, which inturn may be either wishes, psychic emotions of any other kind, or simplyrecent impressions. We have thus made room for any claims that may bemade for the importance of conscious thought activity in dreamformations in all its variations. Relying upon our thought series, itwould not be at all impossible for us to explain even those extremecases in which the dream as a continuer of the day work brings to ahappy conclusion and unsolved problem possess an example, the analysisof which might reveal the infantile or repressed wish source furnishingsuch alliance and successful strengthening of the efforts of theforeconscious activity. But we have not come one step nearer a solutionof the riddle: Why can the unconscious furnish the motive power for thewish-fulfillment only during sleep? The answer to this question mustthrow light on the psychic nature of wishes; and it will be given withthe aid of the diagram of the psychic apparatus.We do not doubt that even this apparatus attained its present perfectionthrough a long course of development. Let us attempt to restore it as itexisted in an early phase of its activity. From assumptions, to beconfirmed elsewhere, we know that at first the apparatus strove to keepas free from excitement as possible, and in its first formation,therefore, the scheme took the form of a reflex apparatus, which enabledit promptly to discharge through the motor tracts any sensible stimulusreaching it from without. But this simple function was disturbed by thewants of life, which likewise furnish the impulse for the furtherdevelopment of the apparatus. The wants of life first manifestedthemselves to it in the form of the great physical needs. The excitementaroused by the inner want seeks an outlet in motility, which may bedesignated as \"inner changes\" or as an \"expression of the emotions.\" Thehungry child cries or fidgets helplessly, but its situation remainsunchanged; for the excitation proceeding from an inner want requires,not a momentary outbreak, but a force working continuously. A change canoccur only if in some way a feeling of gratification isexperienced--which in the case of the child must be through outsidehelp--in order to remove the inner excitement. An essential constituentof this experience is the appearance of a certain perception (of food inour example), the memory picture of which thereafter remains associatedwith the memory trace of the excitation of want.Thanks to the established connection, there results at the nextappearance of this want a psychic feeling which revives the memorypicture of the former perception, and thus recalls the former perceptionitself, _i.e._ it actually re-establishes the situation of the firstgratification. We call such a feeling a wish; the reappearance of theperception constitutes the wish-fulfillment, and the full revival of theperception by the want excitement constitutes the shortest road to thewish-fulfillment. We may assume a primitive condition of the psychicapparatus in which this road is really followed, _i.e._ where thewishing merges into an hallucination, This first psychic activitytherefore aims at an identity of perception, _i.e._ it aims at arepetition of that perception which is connected with the fulfillment ofthe want.This primitive mental activity must have been modified by bitterpractical experience into a more expedient secondary activity. Theestablishment of the identity perception on the short regressive roadwithin the apparatus does not in another respect carry with it theresult which inevitably follows the revival of the same perception fromwithout. The gratification does not take place, and the want continues.In order to equalize the internal with the external sum of energy, theformer must be continually maintained, just as actually happens in thehallucinatory psychoses and in the deliriums of hunger which exhausttheir psychic capacity in clinging to the object desired. In order tomake more appropriate use of the psychic force, it becomes necessary toinhibit the full regression so as to prevent it from extending beyondthe image of memory, whence it can select other paths leading ultimatelyto the establishment of the desired identity from the outer world. Thisinhibition and consequent deviation from the excitation becomes thetask of a second system which dominates the voluntary motility, _i.e._through whose activity the expenditure of motility is now devoted topreviously recalled purposes. But this entire complicated mentalactivity which works its way from the memory picture to theestablishment of the perception identity from the outer world merelyrepresents a detour which has been forced upon the wish-fulfillment byexperience.[2] Thinking is indeed nothing but the equivalent of thehallucinatory wish; and if the dream be called a wish-fulfillment thisbecomes self-evident, as nothing but a wish can impel our psychicapparatus to activity. The dream, which in fulfilling its wishes followsthe short regressive path, thereby preserves for us only an example ofthe primary form of the psychic apparatus which has been abandoned asinexpedient. What once ruled in the waking state when the psychic lifewas still young and unfit seems to have been banished into the sleepingstate, just as we see again in the nursery the bow and arrow, thediscarded primitive weapons of grown-up humanity. _The dream is afragment of the abandoned psychic life of the child._ In the psychosesthese modes of operation of the psychic apparatus, which are normallysuppressed in the waking state, reassert themselves, and then betraytheir inability to satisfy our wants in the outer world.The unconscious wish-feelings evidently strive to assert themselvesduring the day also, and the fact of transference and the psychosesteach us that they endeavor to penetrate to consciousness and dominatemotility by the road leading through the system of the foreconscious. Itis, therefore, the censor lying between the Unc. and the Forec., theassumption of which is forced upon us by the dream, that we have torecognize and honor as the guardian of our psychic health. But is it notcarelessness on the part of this guardian to diminish its vigilanceduring the night and to allow the suppressed emotions of the Unc. tocome to expression, thus again making possible the hallucinatoryregression? I think not, for when the critical guardian goes torest--and we have proof that his slumber is not profound--he takes careto close the gate to motility. No matter what feelings from theotherwise inhibited Unc. may roam about on the scene, they need not beinterfered with; they remain harmless because they are unable to put inmotion the motor apparatus which alone can exert a modifying influenceupon the outer world. Sleep guarantees the security of the fortresswhich is under guard. Conditions are less harmless when a displacementof forces is produced, not through a nocturnal diminution in theoperation of the critical censor, but through pathological enfeeblementof the latter or through pathological reinforcement of the unconsciousexcitations, and this while the foreconscious is charged with energy andthe avenues to motility are open. The guardian is then overpowered, theunconscious excitations subdue the Forec.; through it they dominate ourspeech and actions, or they enforce the hallucinatory regression, thusgoverning an apparatus not designed for them by virtue of the attractionexerted by the perceptions on the distribution of our psychic energy. Wecall this condition a psychosis.We are now in the best position to complete our psychologicalconstruction, which has been interrupted by the introduction of the twosystems, Unc. and Forec. We have still, however, ample reason for givingfurther consideration to the wish as the sole psychic motive power inthe dream. We have explained that the reason why the dream is in everycase a wish realization is because it is a product of the Unc., whichknows no other aim in its activity but the fulfillment of wishes, andwhich has no other forces at its disposal but wish-feelings. If weavail ourselves for a moment longer of the right to elaborate from thedream interpretation such far-reaching psychological speculations, weare in duty bound to demonstrate that we are thereby bringing the dreaminto a relationship which may also comprise other psychic structures. Ifthere exists a system of the Unc.--or something sufficiently analogousto it for the purpose of our discussion--the dream cannot be its solemanifestation; every dream may be a wish-fulfillment, but there must beother forms of abnormal wish-fulfillment beside this of dreams. Indeed,the theory of all psychoneurotic symptoms culminates in the proposition_that they too must be taken as wish-fulfillments of the unconscious_.Our explanation makes the dream only the first member of a group mostimportant for the psychiatrist, an understanding of which means thesolution of the purely psychological part of the psychiatric problem.But other members of this group of wish-fulfillments, _e.g._, thehysterical symptoms, evince one essential quality which I have so farfailed to find in the dream. Thus, from the investigations frequentlyreferred to in this treatise, I know that the formation of an hystericalsymptom necessitates the combination of both streams of our psychiclife. The symptom is not merely the expression of a realizedunconscious wish, but it must be joined by another wish from theforeconscious which is fulfilled by the same symptom; so that thesymptom is at least doubly determined, once by each one of theconflicting systems. Just as in the dream, there is no limit to furtherover-determination. The determination not derived from the Unc. is, asfar as I can see, invariably a stream of thought in reaction against theunconscious wish, _e.g._, a self-punishment. Hence I may say, ingeneral, that _an hysterical symptom originates only where twocontrasting wish-fulfillments, having their source in different psychicsystems, are able to combine in one expression_. (Compare my latestformulation of the origin of the hysterical symptoms in a treatisepublished by the _Zeitschrift fÃ¼r Sexualwissenschaft_, by Hirschfeld andothers, 1908). Examples on this point would prove of little value, asnothing but a complete unveiling of the complication in question wouldcarry conviction. I therefore content myself with the mere assertion,and will cite an example, not for conviction but for explication. Thehysterical vomiting of a female patient proved, on the one hand, to bethe realization of an unconscious fancy from the time of puberty, thatshe might be continuously pregnant and have a multitude of children,and this was subsequently united with the wish that she might have themfrom as many men as possible. Against this immoderate wish there arose apowerful defensive impulse. But as the vomiting might spoil thepatient\\'s figure and beauty, so that she would not find favor in theeyes of mankind, the symptom was therefore in keeping with her punitivetrend of thought, and, being thus admissible from both sides, it wasallowed to become a reality. This is the same manner of consenting to awish-fulfillment which the queen of the Parthians chose for the triumvirCrassus. Believing that he had undertaken the campaign out of greed forgold, she caused molten gold to be poured into the throat of the corpse.\"Now hast thou what thou hast longed for.\" As yet we know of the dreamonly that it expresses a wish-fulfillment of the unconscious; andapparently the dominating foreconscious permits this only after it hassubjected the wish to some distortions. We are really in no position todemonstrate regularly a stream of thought antagonistic to the dream-wishwhich is realized in the dream as in its counterpart. Only now and thenhave we found in the dream traces of reaction formations, as, forinstance, the tenderness toward friend R. in the \"uncle dream.\" But thecontribution from the foreconscious, which is missing here, may befound in another place. While the dominating system has withdrawn onthe wish to sleep, the dream may bring to expression with manifolddistortions a wish from the Unc., and realize this wish by producing thenecessary changes of energy in the psychic apparatus, and may finallyretain it through the entire duration of sleep.[3]This persistent wish to sleep on the part of the foreconscious ingeneral facilitates the formation of the dream. Let us refer to thedream of the father who, by the gleam of light from the death chamber,was brought to the conclusion that the body has been set on fire. Wehave shown that one of the psychic forces decisive in causing the fatherto form this conclusion, instead of being awakened by the gleam oflight, was the wish to prolong the life of the child seen in the dreamby one moment. Other wishes proceeding from the repression probablyescape us, because we are unable to analyze this dream. But as a secondmotive power of the dream we may mention the father\\'s desire to sleep,for, like the life of the child, the sleep of the father is prolongedfor a moment by the dream. The underlying motive is: \"Let the dream goon, otherwise I must wake up.\" As in this dream so also in all otherdreams, the wish to sleep lends its support to the unconscious wish. Wereported dreams which were apparently dreams of convenience. But,properly speaking, all dreams may claim this designation. The efficacyof the wish to continue to sleep is the most easily recognized in thewaking dreams, which so transform the objective sensory stimulus as torender it compatible with the continuance of sleep; they interweave thisstimulus with the dream in order to rob it of any claims it might makeas a warning to the outer world. But this wish to continue to sleep mustalso participate in the formation of all other dreams which may disturbthe sleeping state from within only. \"Now, then, sleep on; why, it\\'s buta dream\"; this is in many cases the suggestion of the Forec. toconsciousness when the dream goes too far; and this also describes in ageneral way the attitude of our dominating psychic activity towarddreaming, though the thought remains tacit. I must draw the conclusionthat _throughout our entire sleeping state we are just as certain thatwe are dreaming as we are certain that we are sleeping_. We arecompelled to disregard the objection urged against this conclusion thatour consciousness is never directed to a knowledge of the former, andthat it is directed to a knowledge of the latter only on specialoccasions when the censor is unexpectedly surprised. Against thisobjection we may say that there are persons who are entirely consciousof their sleeping and dreaming, and who are apparently endowed with theconscious faculty of guiding their dream life. Such a dreamer, whendissatisfied with the course taken by the dream, breaks it off withoutawakening, and begins it anew in order to continue it with a differentturn, like the popular author who, on request, gives a happier ending tohis play. Or, at another time, if placed by the dream in a sexuallyexciting situation, he thinks in his sleep: \"I do not care to continuethis dream and exhaust myself by a pollution; I prefer to defer it infavor of a real situation.\"[1] They share this character of indestructibility with all psychic actsthat are really unconscious--that is, with psychic acts belonging to thesystem of the unconscious only. These paths are constantly open andnever fall into disuse; they conduct the discharge of the excitingprocess as often as it becomes endowed with unconscious excitement Tospeak metaphorically they suffer the same form of annihilation as theshades of the lower region in the _Odyssey_, who awoke to new life themoment they drank blood. The processes depending on the foreconscioussystem are destructible in a different way. The psychotherapy of theneuroses is based on this difference.[2] Le Lorrain justly extols the wish-fulfilment of the dream: \"Sansfatigue sÃ©rieuse, sans Ãªtre obligÃ© de recourir Ã\\xa0 cette lutte opinÃ¢tre etlongue qui use et corrode les jouissances poursuivies.\"[3] This idea has been borrowed from _The Theory of Sleep_ by LiÃ©bault,who revived hypnotic investigation in our days. (_Du Sommeil provoquÃ©_,etc.; Paris, 1889.)VIITHE FUNCTION OF THE DREAMSince we know that the foreconscious is suspended during the night bythe wish to sleep, we can proceed to an intelligent investigation of thedream process. But let us first sum up the knowledge of this processalready gained. We have shown that the waking activity leaves dayremnants from which the sum of energy cannot be entirely removed; or thewaking activity revives during the day one of the unconscious wishes; orboth conditions occur simultaneously; we have already discovered themany variations that may take place. The unconscious wish has alreadymade its way to the day remnants, either during the day or at any ratewith the beginning of sleep, and has effected a transference to it. Thisproduces a wish transferred to the recent material, or the suppressedrecent wish comes to life again through a reinforcement from theunconscious. This wish now endeavors to make its way to consciousness onthe normal path of the mental processes through the foreconscious, towhich indeed it belongs through one of its constituent elements. It isconfronted, however, by the censor, which is still active, and to theinfluence of which it now succumbs. It now takes on the distortion forwhich the way has already been paved by its transference to the recentmaterial. Thus far it is in the way of becoming something resembling anobsession, delusion, or the like, _i.e._ a thought reinforced by atransference and distorted in expression by the censor. But its furtherprogress is now checked through the dormant state of the foreconscious;this system has apparently protected itself against invasion bydiminishing its excitements. The dream process, therefore, takes theregressive course, which has just been opened by the peculiarity of thesleeping state, and thereby follows the attraction exerted on it by thememory groups, which themselves exist in part only as visual energy notyet translated into terms of the later systems. On its way to regressionthe dream takes on the form of dramatization. The subject of compressionwill be discussed later. The dream process has now terminated the secondpart of its repeatedly impeded course. The first part expended itselfprogressively from the unconscious scenes or phantasies to theforeconscious, while the second part gravitates from the advent of thecensor back to the perceptions. But when the dream process becomes acontent of perception it has, so to speak, eluded the obstacle set up inthe Forec. by the censor and by the sleeping state. It succeeds indrawing attention to itself and in being noticed by consciousness. Forconsciousness, which means to us a sensory organ for the reception ofpsychic qualities, may receive stimuli from two sources--first, from theperiphery of the entire apparatus, viz. from the perception system, and,secondly, from the pleasure and pain stimuli, which constitute the solepsychic quality produced in the transformation of energy within theapparatus. All other processes in the system, even those in theforeconscious, are devoid of any psychic quality, and are therefore notobjects of consciousness inasmuch as they do not furnish pleasure orpain for perception. We shall have to assume that those liberations ofpleasure and pain automatically regulate the outlet of the occupationprocesses. But in order to make possible more delicate functions, it waslater found necessary to render the course of the presentations moreindependent of the manifestations of pain. To accomplish this the Forec.system needed some qualities of its own which could attractconsciousness, and most probably received them through the connection ofthe foreconscious processes with the memory system of the signs ofspeech, which is not devoid of qualities. Through the qualities of thissystem, consciousness, which had hitherto been a sensory organ only forthe perceptions, now becomes also a sensory organ for a part of ourmental processes. Thus we have now, as it were, two sensory surfaces,one directed to perceptions and the other to the foreconscious mentalprocesses.I must assume that the sensory surface of consciousness devoted to theForec. is rendered less excitable by sleep than that directed to theP-systems. The giving up of interest for the nocturnal mental processesis indeed purposeful. Nothing is to disturb the mind; the Forec. wantsto sleep. But once the dream becomes a perception, it is then capable ofexciting consciousness through the qualities thus gained. The sensorystimulus accomplishes what it was really destined for, namely, itdirects a part of the energy at the disposal of the Forec. in the formof attention upon the stimulant. We must, therefore, admit that thedream invariably awakens us, that is, it puts into activity a part ofthe dormant force of the Forec. This force imparts to the dream thatinfluence which we have designated as secondary elaboration for the sakeof connection and comprehensibility. This means that the dream istreated by it like any other content of perception; it is subjected tothe same ideas of expectation, as far at least as the material admits.As far as the direction is concerned in this third part of the dream, itmay be said that here again the movement is progressive.To avoid misunderstanding, it will not be amiss to say a few words aboutthe temporal peculiarities of these dream processes. In a veryinteresting discussion, apparently suggested by Maury\\'s puzzlingguillotine dream, Goblet tries to demonstrate that the dream requires noother time than the transition period between sleeping and awakening.The awakening requires time, as the dream takes place during thatperiod. One is inclined to believe that the final picture of the dreamis so strong that it forces the dreamer to awaken; but, as a matter offact, this picture is strong only because the dreamer is already verynear awakening when it appears. \"Un rÃªve c\\'est un rÃ©veil qui commence.\"It has already been emphasized by Dugas that Goblet was forced torepudiate many facts in order to generalize his theory. There are,moreover, dreams from which we do not awaken, _e.g._, some dreams inwhich we dream that we dream. From our knowledge of the dream-work, wecan by no means admit that it extends only over the period of awakening.On the contrary, we must consider it probable that the first part ofthe dream-work begins during the day when we are still under thedomination of the foreconscious. The second phase of the dream-work,viz. the modification through the censor, the attraction by theunconscious scenes, and the penetration to perception must continuethroughout the night. And we are probably always right when we assertthat we feel as though we had been dreaming the whole night, although wecannot say what. I do not, however, think it necessary to assume that,up to the time of becoming conscious, the dream processes really followthe temporal sequence which we have described, viz. that there is firstthe transferred dream-wish, then the distortion of the censor, andconsequently the change of direction to regression, and so on. We wereforced to form such a succession for the sake of _description_; inreality, however, it is much rather a matter of simultaneously tryingthis path and that, and of emotions fluctuating to and fro, untilfinally, owing to the most expedient distribution, one particulargrouping is secured which remains. From certain personal experiences, Iam myself inclined to believe that the dream-work often requires morethan one day and one night to produce its result; if this be true, theextraordinary art manifested in the construction of the dream loses allits marvels. In my opinion, even the regard for comprehensibility as anoccurrence of perception may take effect before the dream attractsconsciousness to itself. To be sure, from now on the process isaccelerated, as the dream is henceforth subjected to the same treatmentas any other perception. It is like fireworks, which require hours ofpreparation and only a moment for ignition.Through the dream-work the dream process now gains either sufficientintensity to attract consciousness to itself and arouse theforeconscious, which is quite independent of the time or profundity ofsleep, or, its intensity being insufficient it must wait until it meetsthe attention which is set in motion immediately before awakening. Mostdreams seem to operate with relatively slight psychic intensities, forthey wait for the awakening. This, however, explains the fact that weregularly perceive something dreamt on being suddenly aroused from asound sleep. Here, as well as in spontaneous awakening, the first glancestrikes the perception content created by the dream-work, while the nextstrikes the one produced from without.But of greater theoretical interest are those dreams which are capableof waking us in the midst of sleep. We must bear in mind the expediencyelsewhere universally demonstrated, and ask ourselves why the dream orthe unconscious wish has the power to disturb sleep, _i.e._ thefulfillment of the foreconscious wish. This is probably due to certainrelations of energy into which we have no insight. If we possessed suchinsight we should probably find that the freedom given to the dream andthe expenditure of a certain amount of detached attention represent forthe dream an economy in energy, keeping in view the fact that theunconscious must be held in check at night just as during the day. Weknow from experience that the dream, even if it interrupts sleep,repeatedly during the same night, still remains compatible with sleep.We wake up for an instant, and immediately resume our sleep. It is likedriving off a fly during sleep, we awake _ad hoc_, and when we resumeour sleep we have removed the disturbance. As demonstrated by familiarexamples from the sleep of wet nurses, &c., the fulfillment of the wishto sleep is quite compatible with the retention of a certain amount ofattention in a given direction.But we must here take cognizance of an objection that is based on abetter knowledge of the unconscious processes. Although we haveourselves described the unconscious wishes as always active, we have,nevertheless, asserted that they are not sufficiently strong during theday to make themselves perceptible. But when we sleep, and theunconscious wish has shown its power to form a dream, and with it toawaken the foreconscious, why, then, does this power become exhaustedafter the dream has been taken cognizance of? Would it not seem moreprobable that the dream should continually renew itself, like thetroublesome fly which, when driven away, takes pleasure in returningagain and again? What justifies our assertion that the dream removes thedisturbance of sleep?That the unconscious wishes always remain active is quite true. Theyrepresent paths which are passable whenever a sum of excitement makesuse of them. Moreover, a remarkable peculiarity of the unconsciousprocesses is the fact that they remain indestructible. Nothing can bebrought to an end in the unconscious; nothing can cease or be forgotten.This impression is most strongly gained in the study of the neuroses,especially of hysteria. The unconscious stream of thought which leads tothe discharge through an attack becomes passable again as soon as thereis an accumulation of a sufficient amount of excitement. Themortification brought on thirty years ago, after having gained access tothe unconscious affective source, operates during all these thirty yearslike a recent one. Whenever its memory is touched, it is revived andshows itself to be supplied with the excitement which is discharged ina motor attack. It is just here that the office of psychotherapy begins,its task being to bring about adjustment and forgetfulness for theunconscious processes. Indeed, the fading of memories and the flaggingof affects, which we are apt to take as self-evident and to explain as aprimary influence of time on the psychic memories, are in realitysecondary changes brought about by painstaking work. It is theforeconscious that accomplishes this work; and the only course to bepursued by psychotherapy is the subjugate the Unc, to the domination ofthe Forec.There are, therefore, two exits for the individual unconscious emotionalprocess. It is either left to itself, in which case it ultimately breaksthrough somewhere and secures for once a discharge for its excitationinto motility; or it succumbs to the influence of the foreconscious, andits excitation becomes confined through this influence instead of beingdischarged. It is the latter process that occurs in the dream. Owing tothe fact that it is directed by the conscious excitement, the energyfrom the Forec., which confronts the dream when grown to perception,restricts the unconscious excitement of the dream and renders itharmless as a disturbing factor. When the dreamer wakes up for a moment,he has actually chased away the fly that has threatened to disturb hissleep. We can now understand that it is really more expedient andeconomical to give full sway to the unconscious wish, and clear its wayto regression so that it may form a dream, and then restrict and adjustthis dream by means of a small expenditure of foreconscious labor, thanto curb the unconscious throughout the entire period of sleep. Weshould, indeed, expect that the dream, even if it was not originally anexpedient process, would have acquired some function in the play offorces of the psychic life. We now see what this function is. The dreamhas taken it upon itself to bring the liberated excitement of the Unc.back under the domination of the foreconscious; it thus affords relieffor the excitement of the Unc. and acts as a safety-valve for thelatter, and at the same time it insures the sleep of the foreconsciousat a slight expenditure of the waking state. Like the other psychicformations of its group, the dream offers itself as a compromise servingsimultaneously both systems by fulfilling both wishes in so far as theyare compatible with each other. A glance at Robert\\'s \"eliminationtheory,\" will show that we must agree with this author in his mainpoint, viz. in the determination of the function of the dream, though wediffer from him in our hypotheses and in our treatment of the dreamprocess.The above qualification--in so far as the two wishes are compatible witheach other--contains a suggestion that there may be cases in which thefunction of the dream suffers shipwreck. The dream process is in thefirst instance admitted as a wish-fulfillment of the unconscious, but ifthis tentative wish-fulfillment disturbs the foreconscious to such anextent that the latter can no longer maintain its rest, the dream thenbreaks the compromise and fails to perform the second part of its task.It is then at once broken off, and replaced by complete wakefulness.Here, too, it is not really the fault of the dream, if, while ordinarilythe guardian of sleep, it is here compelled to appear as the disturberof sleep, nor should this cause us to entertain any doubts as to itsefficacy. This is not the only case in the organism in which anotherwise efficacious arrangement became inefficacious and disturbing assoon as some element is changed in the conditions of its origin; thedisturbance then serves at least the new purpose of announcing thechange, and calling into play against it the means of adjustment of theorganism. In this connection, I naturally bear in mind the case of theanxiety dream, and in order not to have the appearance of trying toexclude this testimony against the theory of wish-fulfillment whereverI encounter it, I will attempt an explanation of the anxiety dream, atleast offering some suggestions.That a psychic process developing anxiety may still be awish-fulfillment has long ceased to impress us as a contradiction. Wemay explain this occurrence by the fact that the wish belongs to onesystem (the Unc.), while by the other system (the Forec.), this wish hasbeen rejected and suppressed. The subjection of the Unc. by the Forec.is not complete even in perfect psychic health; the amount of thissuppression shows the degree of our psychic normality. Neurotic symptomsshow that there is a conflict between the two systems; the symptoms arethe results of a compromise of this conflict, and they temporarily putan end to it. On the one hand, they afford the Unc. an outlet for thedischarge of its excitement, and serve it as a sally port, while, on theother hand, they give the Forec. the capability of dominating the Unc.to some extent. It is highly instructive to consider, _e.g._, thesignificance of any hysterical phobia or of an agoraphobia. Suppose aneurotic incapable of crossing the street alone, which we would justlycall a \"symptom.\" We attempt to remove this symptom by urging him to theaction which he deems himself incapable of. The result will be anattack of anxiety, just as an attack of anxiety in the street has oftenbeen the cause of establishing an agoraphobia. We thus learn that thesymptom has been constituted in order to guard against the outbreak ofthe anxiety. The phobia is thrown before the anxiety like a fortress onthe frontier.Unless we enter into the part played by the affects in these processes,which can be done here only imperfectly, we cannot continue ourdiscussion. Let us therefore advance the proposition that the reason whythe suppression of the unconscious becomes absolutely necessary isbecause, if the discharge of presentation should be left to itself, itwould develop an affect in the Unc. which originally bore the characterof pleasure, but which, since the appearance of the repression, bearsthe character of pain. The aim, as well as the result, of thesuppression is to stop the development of this pain. The suppressionextends over the unconscious ideation, because the liberation of painmight emanate from the ideation. The foundation is here laid for a verydefinite assumption concerning the nature of the affective development.It is regarded as a motor or secondary activity, the key to theinnervation of which is located in the presentations of the Unc. Throughthe domination of the Forec. these presentations become, as it were,throttled and inhibited at the exit of the emotion-developing impulses.The danger, which is due to the fact that the Forec. ceases to occupythe energy, therefore consists in the fact that the unconsciousexcitations liberate such an affect as--in consequence of the repressionthat has previously taken place--can only be perceived as pain oranxiety.This danger is released through the full sway of the dream process. Thedeterminations for its realization consist in the fact that repressionshave taken place, and that the suppressed emotional wishes shall becomesufficiently strong. They thus stand entirely without the psychologicalrealm of the dream structure. Were it not for the fact that our subjectis connected through just one factor, namely, the freeing of the Unc.during sleep, with the subject of the development of anxiety, I coulddispense with discussion of the anxiety dream, and thus avoid allobscurities connected with it.As I have often repeated, the theory of the anxiety belongs to thepsychology of the neuroses. I would say that the anxiety in the dream isan anxiety problem and not a dream problem. We have nothing further todo with it after having once demonstrated its point of contact with thesubject of the dream process. There is only one thing left for me to do.As I have asserted that the neurotic anxiety originates from sexualsources, I can subject anxiety dreams to analysis in order todemonstrate the sexual material in their dream thoughts.For good reasons I refrain from citing here any of the numerous examplesplaced at my disposal by neurotic patients, but prefer to give anxietydreams from young persons.Personally, I have had no real anxiety dream for decades, but I recallone from my seventh or eighth year which I subjected to interpretationabout thirty years later. The dream was very vivid, and showed me _mybeloved mother, with peculiarly calm sleeping countenance, carried intothe room and laid on the bed by two (or three) persons with birds\\'beaks_. I awoke crying and screaming, and disturbed my parents. The verytall figures--draped in a peculiar manner--with beaks, I had taken fromthe illustrations of Philippson\\'s bible; I believe they representeddeities with heads of sparrowhawks from an Egyptian tomb relief. Theanalysis also introduced the reminiscence of a naughty janitor\\'s boy,who used to play with us children on the meadow in front of the house; Iwould add that his name was Philip. I feel that I first heard from thisboy the vulgar word signifying sexual intercourse, which is replacedamong the educated by the Latin \"coitus,\" but to which the dreamdistinctly alludes by the selection of the birds\\' heads. I must havesuspected the sexual significance of the word from the facial expressionof my worldly-wise teacher. My mother\\'s features in the dream werecopied from the countenance of my grandfather, whom I had seen a fewdays before his death snoring in the state of coma. The interpretationof the secondary elaboration in the dream must therefore have been thatmy mother was dying; the tomb relief, too, agrees with this. In thisanxiety I awoke, and could not calm myself until I had awakened myparents. I remember that I suddenly became calm on coming face to facewith my mother, as if I needed the assurance that my mother was notdead. But this secondary interpretation of the dream had been effectedonly under the influence of the developed anxiety. I was not frightenedbecause I dreamed that my mother was dying, but I interpreted the dreamin this manner in the foreconscious elaboration because I was alreadyunder the domination of the anxiety. The latter, however, could betraced by means of the repression to an obscure obviously sexual desire,which had found its satisfying expression in the visual content of thedream.A man twenty-seven years old who had been severely ill for a year hadhad many terrifying dreams between the ages of eleven and thirteen. Hethought that a man with an ax was running after him; he wished to run,but felt paralyzed and could not move from the spot. This may be takenas a good example of a very common, and apparently sexually indifferent,anxiety dream. In the analysis the dreamer first thought of a story toldhim by his uncle, which chronologically was later than the dream, viz.that he was attacked at night by a suspicious-looking individual. Thisoccurrence led him to believe that he himself might have already heardof a similar episode at the time of the dream. In connection with the axhe recalled that during that period of his life he once hurt his handwith an ax while chopping wood. This immediately led to his relationswith his younger brother, whom he used to maltreat and knock down. Inparticular, he recalled an occasion when he struck his brother on thehead with his boot until he bled, whereupon his mother remarked: \"I fearhe will kill him some day.\" While he was seemingly thinking of thesubject of violence, a reminiscence from his ninth year suddenlyoccurred to him. His parents came home late and went to bed while he wasfeigning sleep. He soon heard panting and other noises that appearedstrange to him, and he could also make out the position of his parentsin bed. His further associations showed that he had established ananalogy between this relation between his parents and his own relationtoward his younger brother. He subsumed what occurred between hisparents under the conception \"violence and wrestling,\" and thus reacheda sadistic conception of the coitus act, as often happens amongchildren. The fact that he often noticed blood on his mother\\'s bedcorroborated his conception.That the sexual intercourse of adults appears strange to children whoobserve it, and arouses fear in them, I dare say is a fact of dailyexperience. I have explained this fear by the fact that sexualexcitement is not mastered by their understanding, and is probably alsoinacceptable to them because their parents are involved in it. For thesame son this excitement is converted into fear. At a still earlierperiod of life sexual emotion directed toward the parent of opposite sexdoes not meet with repression but finds free expression, as we have seenbefore.For the night terrors with hallucinations (_pavor nocturnus_) frequentlyfound in children, I would unhesitatingly give the same explanation.Here, too, we are certainly dealing with the incomprehensible andrejected sexual feelings, which, if noted, would probably show atemporal periodicity, for an enhancement of the sexual _libido_ mayjust as well be produced accidentally through emotional impressions asthrough the spontaneous and gradual processes of development.I lack the necessary material to sustain these explanations fromobservation. On the other hand, the pediatrists seem to lack the pointof view which alone makes comprehensible the whole series of phenomena,on the somatic as well as on the psychic side. To illustrate by acomical example how one wearing the blinders of medical mythology maymiss the understanding of such cases I will relate a case which I foundin a thesis on _pavor nocturnus_ by _Debacker_, 1881. Athirteen-year-old boy of delicate health began to become anxious anddreamy; his sleep became restless, and about once a week it wasinterrupted by an acute attack of anxiety with hallucinations. Thememory of these dreams was invariably very distinct. Thus, he relatedthat the _devil_ shouted at him: \"Now we have you, now we have you,\" andthis was followed by an odor of sulphur; the fire burned his skin. Thisdream aroused him, terror-stricken. He was unable to scream at first;then his voice returned, and he was heard to say distinctly: \"No, no,not me; why, I have done nothing,\" or, \"Please don\\'t, I shall never doit again.\" Occasionally, also, he said: \"Albert has not done that.\"Later he avoided undressing, because, as he said, the fire attacked himonly when he was undressed. From amid these evil dreams, which menacedhis health, he was sent into the country, where he recovered within ayear and a half, but at the age of fifteen he once confessed: \"Jen\\'osais pas l\\'avouer, mais j\\'Ã©prouvais continuellement des picotementset des surexcitations aux _parties_; Ã\\xa0 la fin, cela m\\'Ã©nervait tant queplusieurs fois, j\\'ai pensÃ© me jeter par la fenÃªtre au dortoir.\"It is certainly not difficult to suspect: 1, that the boy had practicedmasturbation in former years, that he probably denied it, and wasthreatened with severe punishment for his wrongdoing (his confession: Jene le ferai plus; his denial: Albert n\\'a jamais fait Ã§a). 2, That underthe pressure of puberty the temptation to self-abuse through thetickling of the genitals was reawakened. 3, That now, however, astruggle of repression arose in him, suppressing the _libido_ andchanging it into fear, which subsequently took the form of thepunishments with which he was then threatened.Let us, however, quote the conclusions drawn by our author. Thisobservation shows: 1, That the influence of puberty may produce in aboy of delicate health a condition of extreme weakness, and that it maylead to a _very marked cerebral anÃ¦mia_.2. This cerebral anÃ¦mia produces a transformation of character,demonomaniacal hallucinations, and very violent nocturnal, perhaps alsodiurnal, states of anxiety.3. Demonomania and the self-reproaches of the day can be traced to theinfluences of religious education which the subject underwent as achild.4. All manifestations disappeared as a result of a lengthy sojourn inthe country, bodily exercise, and the return of physical strength afterthe termination of the period of puberty.5. A predisposing influence for the origin of the cerebral condition ofthe boy may be attributed to heredity and to the father\\'s chronicsyphilitic state.The concluding remarks of the author read: \"Nous avons fait entrer cetteobservation dans le cadre des dÃ©lires apyrÃ©tiques d\\'inanition, car c\\'estÃ\\xa0 l\\'ischÃ©mie cÃ©rÃ©brale que nous rattachons cet Ã©tat particulier.\"VIIITHE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY PROCESS--REGRESSIONIn venturing to attempt to penetrate more deeply into the psychology ofthe dream processes, I have undertaken a difficult task, to which,indeed, my power of description is hardly equal. To reproduce indescription by a succession of words the simultaneousness of so complexa chain of events, and in doing so to appear unbiassed throughout theexposition, goes fairly beyond my powers. I have now to atone for thefact that I have been unable in my description of the dream psychologyto follow the historic development of my views. The view-points for myconception of the dream were reached through earlier investigations inthe psychology of the neuroses, to which I am not supposed to referhere, but to which I am repeatedly forced to refer, whereas I shouldprefer to proceed in the opposite direction, and, starting from thedream, to establish a connection with the psychology of the neuroses. Iam well aware of all the inconveniences arising for the reader from thisdifficulty, but I know of no way to avoid them.As I am dissatisfied with this state of affairs, I am glad to dwellupon another view-point which seems to raise the value of my efforts. Ashas been shown in the introduction to the first chapter, I found myselfconfronted with a theme which had been marked by the sharpestcontradictions on the part of the authorities. After our elaboration ofthe dream problems we found room for most of these contradictions. Wehave been forced, however, to take decided exception to two of the viewspronounced, viz. that the dream is a senseless and that it is a somaticprocess; apart from these cases we have had to accept all thecontradictory views in one place or another of the complicated argument,and we have been able to demonstrate that they had discovered somethingthat was correct. That the dream continues the impulses and interests ofthe waking state has been quite generally confirmed through thediscovery of the latent thoughts of the dream. These thoughts concernthemselves only with things that seem important and of momentousinterest to us. The dream never occupies itself with trifles. But wehave also concurred with the contrary view, viz., that the dream gathersup the indifferent remnants from the day, and that not until it has insome measure withdrawn itself from the waking activity can an importantevent of the day be taken up by the dream. We found this holding truefor the dream content, which gives the dream thought its changedexpression by means of disfigurement. We have said that from the natureof the association mechanism the dream process more easily takespossession of recent or indifferent material which has not yet beenseized by the waking mental activity; and by reason of the censor ittransfers the psychic intensity from the important but also disagreeableto the indifferent material. The hypermnesia of the dream and the resortto infantile material have become main supports in our theory. In ourtheory of the dream we have attributed to the wish originating from theinfantile the part of an indispensable motor for the formation of thedream. We naturally could not think of doubting the experimentallydemonstrated significance of the objective sensory stimuli during sleep;but we have brought this material into the same relation to thedream-wish as the thought remnants from the waking activity. There wasno need of disputing the fact that the dream interprets the objectivesensory stimuli after the manner of an illusion; but we have suppliedthe motive for this interpretation which has been left undecided by theauthorities. The interpretation follows in such a manner that theperceived object is rendered harmless as a sleep disturber and becomesavailable for the wish-fulfillment. Though we do not admit as specialsources of the dream the subjective state of excitement of the sensoryorgans during sleep, which seems to have been demonstrated by TrumbullLadd, we are nevertheless able to explain this excitement through theregressive revival of active memories behind the dream. A modest part inour conception has also been assigned to the inner organic sensationswhich are wont to be taken as the cardinal point in the explanation ofthe dream. These--the sensation of falling, flying, or inhibition--standas an ever ready material to be used by the dream-work to express thedream thought as often as need arises.That the dream process is a rapid and momentary one seems to be true forthe perception through consciousness of the already prepared dreamcontent; the preceding parts of the dream process probably take a slow,fluctuating course. We have solved the riddle of the superabundant dreamcontent compressed within the briefest moment by explaining that this isdue to the appropriation of almost fully formed structures from thepsychic life. That the dream is disfigured and distorted by memory wefound to be correct, but not troublesome, as this is only the lastmanifest operation in the work of disfigurement which has been activefrom the beginning of the dream-work. In the bitter and seeminglyirreconcilable controversy as to whether the psychic life sleeps atnight or can make the same use of all its capabilities as during theday, we have been able to agree with both sides, though not fully witheither. We have found proof that the dream thoughts represent a mostcomplicated intellectual activity, employing almost every meansfurnished by the psychic apparatus; still it cannot be denied that thesedream thoughts have originated during the day, and it is indispensableto assume that there is a sleeping state of the psychic life. Thus, eventhe theory of partial sleep has come into play; but the characteristicsof the sleeping state have been found not in the dilapidation of thepsychic connections but in the cessation of the psychic systemdominating the day, arising from its desire to sleep. The withdrawalfrom the outer world retains its significance also for our conception;though not the only factor, it nevertheless helps the regression to makepossible the representation of the dream. That we should reject thevoluntary guidance of the presentation course is uncontestable; but thepsychic life does not thereby become aimless, for we have seen thatafter the abandonment of the desired end-presentation undesired onesgain the mastery. The loose associative connection in the dream we havenot only recognized, but we have placed under its control a far greaterterritory than could have been supposed; we have, however, found itmerely the feigned substitute for another correct and senseful one. Tobe sure we, too, have called the dream absurd; but we have been able tolearn from examples how wise the dream really is when it simulatesabsurdity. We do not deny any of the functions that have been attributedto the dream. That the dream relieves the mind like a valve, and that,according to Robert\\'s assertion, all kinds of harmful material arerendered harmless through representation in the dream, not only exactlycoincides with our theory of the twofold wish-fulfillment in the dream,but, in his own wording, becomes even more comprehensible for us thanfor Robert himself. The free indulgence of the psychic in the play ofits faculties finds expression with us in the non-interference with thedream on the part of the foreconscious activity. The \"return to theembryonal state of psychic life in the dream\" and the observation ofHavelock Ellis, \"an archaic world of vast emotions and imperfectthoughts,\" appear to us as happy anticipations of our deductions to theeffect that _primitive_ modes of work suppressed during the dayparticipate in the formation of the dream; and with us, as with Delage,the _suppressed_ material becomes the mainspring of the dreaming.We have fully recognized the rÃ´le which Scherner ascribes to the dreamphantasy, and even his interpretation; but we have been obliged, so tospeak, to conduct them to another department in the problem. It is notthe dream that produces the phantasy but the unconscious phantasy thattakes the greatest part in the formation of the dream thoughts. We areindebted to Scherner for his clew to the source of the dream thoughts,but almost everything that he ascribes to the dream-work is attributableto the activity of the unconscious, which is at work during the day, andwhich supplies incitements not only for dreams but for neurotic symptomsas well. We have had to separate the dream-work from this activity asbeing something entirely different and far more restricted. Finally, wehave by no means abandoned the relation of the dream to mentaldisturbances, but, on the contrary, we have given it a more solidfoundation on new ground.Thus held together by the new material of our theory as by a superiorunity, we find the most varied and most contradictory conclusions of theauthorities fitting into our structure; some of them are differentlydisposed, only a few of them are entirely rejected. But our ownstructure is still unfinished. For, disregarding the many obscuritieswhich we have necessarily encountered in our advance into the darknessof psychology, we are now apparently embarrassed by a new contradiction.On the one hand, we have allowed the dream thoughts to proceed fromperfectly normal mental operations, while, on the other hand, we havefound among the dream thoughts a number of entirely abnormal mentalprocesses which extend likewise to the dream contents. These,consequently, we have repeated in the interpretation of the dream. Allthat we have termed the \"dream-work\" seems so remote from the psychicprocesses recognized by us as correct, that the severest judgments ofthe authors as to the low psychic activity of dreaming seem to us wellfounded.Perhaps only through still further advance can enlightenment andimprovement be brought about. I shall pick out one of the constellationsleading to the formation of dreams.We have learned that the dream replaces a number of thoughts derivedfrom daily life which are perfectly formed logically. We cannottherefore doubt that these thoughts originate from our normal mentallife. All the qualities which we esteem in our mental operations, andwhich distinguish these as complicated activities of a high order, wefind repeated in the dream thoughts. There is, however, no need ofassuming that this mental work is performed during sleep, as this wouldmaterially impair the conception of the psychic state of sleep we havehitherto adhered to. These thoughts may just as well have originatedfrom the day, and, unnoticed by our consciousness from their inception,they may have continued to develop until they stood complete at theonset of sleep. If we are to conclude anything from this state ofaffairs, it will at most prove _that the most complex mental operationsare possible without the coÃ¶peration of consciousness_, which we havealready learned independently from every psychoanalysis of personssuffering from hysteria or obsessions. These dream thoughts are inthemselves surely not incapable of consciousness; if they have notbecome conscious to us during the day, this may have various reasons.The state of becoming conscious depends on the exercise of a certainpsychic function, viz. attention, which seems to be extended only in adefinite quantity, and which may have been withdrawn from the stream ofthought in Question by other aims. Another way in which such mentalstreams are kept from consciousness is the following:--Our consciousreflection teaches us that when exercising attention we pursue adefinite course. But if that course leads us to an idea which does nothold its own with the critic, we discontinue and cease to apply ourattention. Now, apparently, the stream of thought thus started andabandoned may spin on without regaining attention unless it reaches aspot of especially marked intensity which forces the return ofattention. An initial rejection, perhaps consciously brought about bythe judgment on the ground of incorrectness or unfitness for the actualpurpose of the mental act, may therefore account for the fact that amental process continues until the onset of sleep unnoticed byconsciousness.Let us recapitulate by saying that we call such a stream of thought aforeconscious one, that we believe it to be perfectly correct, and thatit may just as well be a more neglected one or an interrupted andsuppressed one. Let us also state frankly in what manner we conceivethis presentation course. We believe that a certain sum of excitement,which we call occupation energy, is displaced from an end-presentationalong the association paths selected by that end-presentation. A\"neglected\" stream of thought has received no such occupation, and froma \"suppressed\" or \"rejected\" one this occupation has been withdrawn;both have thus been left to their own emotions. The end-stream ofthought stocked with energy is under certain conditions able to draw toitself the attention of consciousness, through which means it thenreceives a \"surplus of energy.\" We shall be obliged somewhat later toelucidate our assumption concerning the nature and activity ofconsciousness.A train of thought thus incited in the Forec. may either disappearspontaneously or continue. The former issue we conceive as follows: Itdiffuses its energy through all the association paths emanating from it,and throws the entire chain of ideas into a state of excitement which,after lasting for a while, subsides through the transformation of theexcitement requiring an outlet into dormant energy.[1] If this firstissue is brought about the process has no further significance for thedream formation. But other end-presentations are lurking in ourforeconscious that originate from the sources of our unconscious andfrom the ever active wishes. These may take possession of theexcitations in the circle of thought thus left to itself, establish aconnection between it and the unconscious wish, and transfer to it theenergy inherent in the unconscious wish. Henceforth the neglected orsuppressed train of thought is in a position to maintain itself,although this reinforcement does not help it to gain access toconsciousness. We may say that the hitherto foreconscious train ofthought has been drawn into the unconscious.Other constellations for the dream formation would result if theforeconscious train of thought had from the beginning been connectedwith the unconscious wish, and for that reason met with rejection by thedominating end-occupation; or if an unconscious wish were made activefor other--possibly somatic--reasons and of its own accord sought atransference to the psychic remnants not occupied by the Forec. Allthree cases finally combine in one issue, so that there is establishedin the foreconscious a stream of thought which, having been abandoned bythe foreconscious occupation, receives occupation from the unconsciouswish.The stream of thought is henceforth subjected to a series oftransformations which we no longer recognize as normal psychic processesand which give us a surprising result, viz. a psychopathologicalformation. Let us emphasize and group the same.1. The intensities of the individual ideas become capable of dischargein their entirety, and, proceeding from one conception to the other,they thus form single presentations endowed with marked intensity.Through the repeated recurrence of this process the intensity of anentire train of ideas may ultimately be gathered in a singlepresentation element. This is the principle of _compression orcondensation_. It is condensation that is mainly responsible for thestrange impression of the dream, for we know of nothing analogous to itin the normal psychic life accessible to consciousness. We find here,also, presentations which possess great psychic significance asjunctions or as end-results of whole chains of thought; but thisvalidity does not manifest itself in any character conspicuous enoughfor internal perception; hence, what has been presented in it does notbecome in any way more intensive. In the process of condensation theentire psychic connection becomes transformed into the intensity of thepresentation content. It is the same as in a book where we space orprint in heavy type any word upon which particular stress is laid forthe understanding of the text. In speech the same word would bepronounced loudly and deliberately and with emphasis. The firstcomparison leads us at once to an example taken from the chapter on \"TheDream-Work\" (trimethylamine in the dream of Irma\\'s injection).Historians of art call our attention to the fact that the most ancienthistorical sculptures follow a similar principle in expressing the rankof the persons represented by the size of the statue. The king is madetwo or three times as large as his retinue or the vanquished enemy. Apiece of art, however, from the Roman period makes use of more subtlemeans to accomplish the same purpose. The figure of the emperor isplaced in the center in a firmly erect posture; special care is bestowedon the proper modelling of his figure; his enemies are seen cowering athis feet; but he is no longer represented a giant among dwarfs. However,the bowing of the subordinate to his superior in our own days is only anecho of that ancient principle of representation.The direction taken by the condensations of the dream is prescribed onthe one hand by the true foreconscious relations of the dream thoughts,an the other hand by the attraction of the visual reminiscences in theunconscious. The success of the condensation work produces thoseintensities which are required for penetration into the perceptionsystems.2. Through this free transferability of the intensities, moreover, andin the service of condensation, _intermediarypresentations_--compromises, as it were--are formed (_cf._ the numerousexamples). This, likewise, is something unheard of in the normalpresentation course, where it is above all a question of selection andretention of the \"proper\" presentation element. On the other hand,composite and compromise formations occur with extraordinary frequencywhen we are trying to find the linguistic expression for foreconsciousthoughts; these are considered \"slips of the tongue.\"3. The presentations which transfer their intensities to one another are_very loosely connected_, and are joined together by such forms ofassociation as are spurned in our serious thought and are utilized inthe production of the effect of wit only. Among these we particularlyfind associations of the sound and consonance types.4. Contradictory thoughts do not strive to eliminate one another, butremain side by side. They often unite to produce condensation _as if nocontradiction_ existed, or they form compromises for which we shouldnever forgive our thoughts, but which we frequently approve of in ouractions.These are some of the most conspicuous abnormal processes to which thethoughts which have previously been rationally formed are subjected inthe course of the dream-work. As the main feature of these processes werecognize the high importance attached to the fact of rendering theoccupation energy mobile and capable of discharge; the content and theactual significance of the psychic elements, to which these energiesadhere, become a matter of secondary importance. One might possiblythink that the condensation and compromise formation is effected only inthe service of regression, when occasion arises for changing thoughtsinto pictures. But the analysis and--still more distinctly--thesynthesis of dreams which lack regression toward pictures, _e.g._ thedream \"Autodidasker--Conversation with Court-Councilor N.,\" present thesame processes of displacement and condensation as the others.Hence we cannot refuse to acknowledge that the two kinds of essentiallydifferent psychic processes participate in the formation of the dream;one forms perfectly correct dream thoughts which are equivalent tonormal thoughts, while the other treats these ideas in a highlysurprising and incorrect manner. The latter process we have already setapart as the dream-work proper. What have we now to advance concerningthis latter psychic process?We should be unable to answer this question here if we had notpenetrated considerably into the psychology of the neuroses andespecially of hysteria. From this we learn that the same incorrectpsychic processes--as well as others that have not beenenumerated--control the formation of hysterical symptoms. In hysteria,too, we at once find a series of perfectly correct thoughts equivalentto our conscious thoughts, of whose existence, however, in this form wecan learn nothing and which we can only subsequently reconstruct. Ifthey have forced their way anywhere to our perception, we discover fromthe analysis of the symptom formed that these normal thoughts have beensubjected to abnormal treatment and _have been transformed into thesymptom by means of condensation and compromise formation, throughsuperficial associations, under cover of contradictions, and eventuallyover the road of regression_. In view of the complete identity foundbetween the peculiarities of the dream-work and of the psychic activityforming the psychoneurotic symptoms, we shall feel justified intransferring to the dream the conclusions urged upon us by hysteria.From the theory of hysteria we borrow the proposition that _such anabnormal psychic elaboration of a normal train of thought takes placeonly when the latter has been used for the transference of anunconscious wish which dates from the infantile life and is in a stateof repression_. In accordance with this proposition we have construedthe theory of the dream on the assumption that the actuating dream-wishinvariably originates in the unconscious, which, as we ourselves haveadmitted, cannot be universally demonstrated though it cannot berefuted. But in order to explain the real meaning of the term_repression_, which we have employed so freely, we shall be obliged tomake some further addition to our psychological construction.We have above elaborated the fiction of a primitive psychic apparatus,whose work is regulated by the efforts to avoid accumulation ofexcitement and as far as possible to maintain itself free fromexcitement. For this reason it was constructed after the plan of areflex apparatus; the motility, originally the path for the inner bodilychange, formed a discharging path standing at its disposal. Wesubsequently discussed the psychic results of a feeling ofgratification, and we might at the same time have introduced the secondassumption, viz. that accumulation of excitement--following certainmodalities that do not concern us--is perceived as pain and sets theapparatus in motion in order to reproduce a feeling of gratification inwhich the diminution of the excitement is perceived as pleasure. Such acurrent in the apparatus which emanates from pain and strives forpleasure we call a wish. We have said that nothing but a wish is capableof setting the apparatus in motion, and that the discharge of excitementin the apparatus is regulated automatically by the perception ofpleasure and pain. The first wish must have been an hallucinatoryoccupation of the memory for gratification. But this hallucination,unless it were maintained to the point of exhaustion, proved incapableof bringing about a cessation of the desire and consequently of securingthe pleasure connected with gratification.Thus there was required a second activity--in our terminology theactivity of a second system--which should not permit the memoryoccupation to advance to perception and therefrom to restrict thepsychic forces, but should lead the excitement emanating from thecraving stimulus by a devious path over the spontaneous motility whichultimately should so change the outer world as to allow the realperception of the object of gratification to take place. Thus far wehave elaborated the plan of the psychic apparatus; these two systems arethe germ of the Unc. and Forec, which we include in the fully developedapparatus.In order to be in a position successfully to change the outer worldthrough the motility, there is required the accumulation of a large sumof experiences in the memory systems as well as a manifold fixation ofthe relations which are evoked in this memory material by differentend-presentations. We now proceed further with our assumption. Themanifold activity of the second system, tentatively sending forth andretracting energy, must on the one hand have full command over allmemory material, but on the other hand it would be a superfluousexpenditure for it to send to the individual mental paths largequantities of energy which would thus flow off to no purpose,diminishing the quantity available for the transformation of the outerworld. In the interests of expediency I therefore postulate that thesecond system succeeds in maintaining the greater part of the occupationenergy in a dormant state and in using but a small portion for thepurposes of displacement. The mechanism of these processes is entirelyunknown to me; any one who wishes to follow up these ideas must try tofind the physical analogies and prepare the way for a demonstration ofthe process of motion in the stimulation of the neuron. I merely hold tothe idea that the activity of the first [Greek: Psi]-system is directed_to the free outflow of the quantities of excitement_, and that thesecond system brings about an inhibition of this outflow through theenergies emanating from it, _i.e._ it produces a _transformation intodormant energy, probably by raising the level_. I therefore assume thatunder the control of the second system as compared with the first, thecourse of the excitement is bound to entirely different mechanicalconditions. After the second system has finished its tentative mentalwork, it removes the inhibition and congestion of the excitements andallows these excitements to flow off to the motility.An interesting train of thought now presents itself if we consider therelations of this inhibition of discharge by the second system to theregulation through the principle of pain. Let us now seek thecounterpart of the primary feeling of gratification, namely, theobjective feeling of fear. A perceptive stimulus acts on the primitiveapparatus, becoming the source of a painful emotion. This will then befollowed by irregular motor manifestations until one of these withdrawsthe apparatus from perception and at the same time from pain, but on thereappearance of the perception this manifestation will immediatelyrepeat itself (perhaps as a movement of flight) until the perception hasagain disappeared. But there will here remain no tendency again tooccupy the perception of the source of pain in the form of anhallucination or in any other form. On the contrary, there will be atendency in the primary apparatus to abandon the painful memory pictureas soon as it is in any way awakened, as the overflow of its excitementwould surely produce (more precisely, begin to produce) pain. Thedeviation from memory, which is but a repetition of the former flightfrom perception, is facilitated also by the fact that, unlikeperception, memory does not possess sufficient quality to exciteconsciousness and thereby to attract to itself new energy. This easy andregularly occurring deviation of the psychic process from the formerpainful memory presents to us the model and the first example of_psychic repression_. As is generally known, much of this deviation fromthe painful, much of the behavior of the ostrich, can be readilydemonstrated even in the normal psychic life of adults.By virtue of the principle of pain the first system is thereforealtogether incapable of introducing anything unpleasant into the mentalassociations. The system cannot do anything but wish. If this remainedso the mental activity of the second system, which should have at itsdisposal all the memories stored up by experiences, would be hindered.But two ways are now opened: the work of the second system either freesitself completely from the principle of pain and continues its course,paying no heed to the painful reminiscence, or it contrives to occupythe painful memory in such a manner as to preclude the liberation ofpain. We may reject the first possibility, as the principle of pain alsomanifests itself as a regulator for the emotional discharge of thesecond system; we are, therefore, directed to the second possibility,namely, that this system occupies a reminiscence in such a manner as toinhibit its discharge and hence, also, to inhibit the dischargecomparable to a motor innervation for the development of pain. Thus fromtwo starting points we are led to the hypothesis that occupation throughthe second system is at the same time an inhibition for the emotionaldischarge, viz. from a consideration of the principle of pain and fromthe principle of the smallest expenditure of innervation. Let us,however, keep to the fact--this is the key to the theory ofrepression--that the second system is capable of occupying an idea onlywhen it is in position to check the development of pain emanating fromit. Whatever withdraws itself from this inhibition also remainsinaccessible for the second system and would soon be abandoned by virtueof the principle of pain. The inhibition of pain, however, need not becomplete; it must be permitted to begin, as it indicates to the secondsystem the nature of the memory and possibly its defective adaptationfor the purpose sought by the mind.The psychic process which is admitted by the first system only I shallnow call the _primary_ process; and the one resulting from theinhibition of the second system I shall call the _secondary_ process. Ishow by another point for what purpose the second system is obliged tocorrect the primary process. The primary process strives for a dischargeof the excitement in order to establish a _perception_ identity with thesum of excitement thus gathered; the secondary process has abandonedthis intention and undertaken instead the task of bringing about a_thought identity_. All thinking is only a circuitous path from thememory of gratification taken as an end-presentation to the identicaloccupation of the same memory, which is again to be attained on thetrack of the motor experiences. The state of thinking must take aninterest in the connecting paths between the presentations withoutallowing itself to be misled by their intensities. But it is obviousthat condensations and intermediate or compromise formations occurringin the presentations impede the attainment of this end-identity; bysubstituting one idea for the other they deviate from the path whichotherwise would have been continued from the original idea. Suchprocesses are therefore carefully avoided in the secondary thinking. Noris it difficult to understand that the principle of pain also impedesthe progress of the mental stream in its pursuit of the thoughtidentity, though, indeed, it offers to the mental stream the mostimportant points of departure. Hence the tendency of the thinkingprocess must be to free itself more and more from exclusive adjustmentby the principle of pain, and through the working of the mind torestrict the affective development to that minimum which is necessary asa signal. This refinement of the activity must have been attainedthrough a recent over-occupation of energy brought about byconsciousness. But we are aware that this refinement is seldomcompletely successful even in the most normal psychic life and that ourthoughts ever remain accessible to falsification through theinterference of the principle of pain.This, however, is not the breach in the functional efficiency of ourpsychic apparatus through which the thoughts forming the material of thesecondary mental work are enabled to make their way into the primarypsychic process--with which formula we may now describe the work leadingto the dream and to the hysterical symptoms. This case of insufficiencyresults from the union of the two factors from the history of ourevolution; one of which belongs solely to the psychic apparatus and hasexerted a determining influence on the relation of the two systems,while the other operates fluctuatingly and introduces motive forces oforganic origin into the psychic life. Both originate in the infantilelife and result from the transformation which our psychic and somaticorganism has undergone since the infantile period.When I termed one of the psychic processes in the psychic apparatus theprimary process, I did so not only in consideration of the order ofprecedence and capability, but also as admitting the temporal relationsto a share in the nomenclature. As far as our knowledge goes there is nopsychic apparatus possessing only the primary process, and in so far itis a theoretic fiction; but so much is based on fact that the primaryprocesses are present in the apparatus from the beginning, while thesecondary processes develop gradually in the course of life, inhibitingand covering the primary ones, and gaining complete mastery over themperhaps only at the height of life. Owing to this retarded appearance ofthe secondary processes, the essence of our being, consisting inunconscious wish feelings, can neither be seized nor inhibited by theforeconscious, whose part is once for all restricted to the indicationof the most suitable paths for the wish feelings originating in theunconscious. These unconscious wishes establish for all subsequentpsychic efforts a compulsion to which they have to submit and whichthey must strive if possible to divert from its course and direct tohigher aims. In consequence of this retardation of the foreconsciousoccupation a large sphere of the memory material remains inaccessible.Among these indestructible and unincumbered wish feelings originatingfrom the infantile life, there are also some, the fulfillments of whichhave entered into a relation of contradiction to the end-presentation ofthe secondary thinking. The fulfillment of these wishes would no longerproduce an affect of pleasure but one of pain; _and it is just thistransformation of affect that constitutes the nature of what wedesignate as \"repression,\" in which we recognize the infantile firststep of passing adverse sentence or of rejecting through reason_. Toinvestigate in what way and through what motive forces such atransformation can be produced constitutes the problem of repression,which we need here only skim over. It will suffice to remark that such atransformation of affect occurs in the course of development (one maythink of the appearance in infantile life of disgust which wasoriginally absent), and that it is connected with the activity of thesecondary system. The memories from which the unconscious wish bringsabout the emotional discharge have never been accessible to the Forec.,and for that reason their emotional discharge cannot be inhibited. Itis just on account of this affective development that these ideas arenot even now accessible to the foreconscious thoughts to which they havetransferred their wishing power. On the contrary, the principle of paincomes into play, and causes the Forec. to deviate from these thoughts oftransference. The latter, left to themselves, are \"repressed,\" and thusthe existence of a store of infantile memories, from the very beginningwithdrawn from the Forec., becomes the preliminary condition ofrepression.In the most favorable case the development of pain terminates as soon asthe energy has been withdrawn from the thoughts of transference in theForec., and this effect characterizes the intervention of the principleof pain as expedient. It is different, however, if the repressedunconscious wish receives an organic enforcement which it can lend toits thoughts of transference and through which it can enable them tomake an effort towards penetration with their excitement, even afterthey have been abandoned by the occupation of the Forec. A defensivestruggle then ensues, inasmuch as the Forec. reinforces the antagonismagainst the repressed ideas, and subsequently this leads to apenetration by the thoughts of transference (the carriers of theunconscious wish) in some form of compromise through symptom formation.But from the moment that the suppressed thoughts are powerfully occupiedby the unconscious wish-feeling and abandoned by the foreconsciousoccupation, they succumb to the primary psychic process and strive onlyfor motor discharge; or, if the path be free, for hallucinatory revivalof the desired perception identity. We have previously found,empirically, that the incorrect processes described are enacted onlywith thoughts that exist in the repression. We now grasp another part ofthe connection. These incorrect processes are those that are primary inthe psychic apparatus; _they appear wherever thoughts abandoned by theforeconscious occupation are left to themselves, and can fill themselveswith the uninhibited energy, striving for discharge from theunconscious_. We may add a few further observations to support the viewthat these processes designated \"incorrect\" are really notfalsifications of the normal defective thinking, but the modes ofactivity of the psychic apparatus when freed from inhibition. Thus wesee that the transference of the foreconscious excitement to themotility takes place according to the same processes, and that theconnection of the foreconscious presentations with words readilymanifest the same displacements and mixtures which are ascribed toinattention. Finally, I should like to adduce proof that an increase ofwork necessarily results from the inhibition of these primary coursesfrom the fact that we gain a _comical effect_, a surplus to bedischarged through laughter, _if we allow these streams of thought tocome to consciousness_.The theory of the psychoneuroses asserts with complete certainty thatonly sexual wish-feelings from the infantile life experience repression(emotional transformation) during the developmental period of childhood.These are capable of returning to activity at a later period ofdevelopment, and then have the faculty of being revived, either as aconsequence of the sexual constitution, which is really formed from theoriginal bisexuality, or in consequence of unfavorable influences of thesexual life; and they thus supply the motive power for allpsychoneurotic symptom formations. It is only by the introduction ofthese sexual forces that the gaps still demonstrable in the theory ofrepression can be filled. I will leave it undecided whether thepostulate of the sexual and infantile may also be asserted for thetheory of the dream; I leave this here unfinished because I have alreadypassed a step beyond the demonstrable in assuming that the dream-wishinvariably originates from the unconscious.[2] Nor will I furtherinvestigate the difference in the play of the psychic forces in thedream formation and in the formation of the hysterical symptoms, for todo this we ought to possess a more explicit knowledge of one of themembers to be compared. But I regard another point as important, andwill here confess that it was on account of this very point that I havejust undertaken this entire discussion concerning the two psychicsystems, their modes of operation, and the repression. For it is nowimmaterial whether I have conceived the psychological relations inquestion with approximate correctness, or, as is easily possible in sucha difficult matter, in an erroneous and fragmentary manner. Whateverchanges may be made in the interpretation of the psychic censor and ofthe correct and of the abnormal elaboration of the dream content, thefact nevertheless remains that such processes are active in dreamformation, and that essentially they show the closest analogy to theprocesses observed in the formation of the hysterical symptoms. Thedream is not a pathological phenomenon, and it does not leave behind anenfeeblement of the mental faculties. The objection that no deductioncan be drawn regarding the dreams of healthy persons from my own dreamsand from those of neurotic patients may be rejected without comment.Hence, when we draw conclusions from the phenomena as to their motiveforces, we recognize that the psychic mechanism made use of by theneuroses is not created by a morbid disturbance of the psychic life, butis found ready in the normal structure of the psychic apparatus. The twopsychic systems, the censor crossing between them, the inhibition andthe covering of the one activity by the other, the relations of both toconsciousness--or whatever may offer a more correct interpretation ofthe actual conditions in their stead--all these belong to the normalstructure of our psychic instrument, and the dream points out for us oneof the roads leading to a knowledge of this structure. If, in additionto our knowledge, we wish to be contented with a minimum perfectlyestablished, we shall say that the dream gives us proof that the_suppressed, material continues to exist even in the normal person andremains capable of psychic activity_. The dream itself is one of themanifestations of this suppressed material; theoretically, this is truein _all_ cases; according to substantial experience it is true in atleast a great number of such as most conspicuously display the prominentcharacteristics of dream life. The suppressed psychic material, which inthe waking state has been prevented from expression and cut off frominternal perception _by the antagonistic adjustment of thecontradictions_, finds ways and means of obtruding itself onconsciousness during the night under the domination of the compromiseformations.     _\"Flectere si nequeo superos, Acheronta movebo.\"_At any rate the interpretation of dreams is the _via regia_ to aknowledge of the unconscious in the psychic life.In following the analysis of the dream we have made some progress towardan understanding of the composition of this most marvelous and mostmysterious of instruments; to be sure, we have not gone very far, butenough of a beginning has been made to allow us to advance from otherso-called pathological formations further into the analysis of theunconscious. Disease--at least that which is justly termedfunctional--is not due to the destruction of this apparatus, and theestablishment of new splittings in its interior; it is rather to beexplained dynamically through the strengthening and weakening of thecomponents in the play of forces by which so many activities areconcealed during the normal function. We have been able to show inanother place how the composition of the apparatus from the two systemspermits a subtilization even of the normal activity which would beimpossible for a single system.[1] _Cf._ the significant observations by J. Bueuer in our _Studies onHysteria_, 1895, and 2nd ed. 1909.[2] Here, as in other places, there are gaps in the treatment of thesubject, which I have left intentionally, because to fill them up wouldrequire on the one hand too great effort, and on the other hand anextensive reference to material that is foreign to the dream. Thus Ihave avoided stating whether I connect with the word \"suppressed\"another sense than with the word \"repressed.\" It has been made clearonly that the latter emphasizes more than the former the relation to theunconscious. I have not entered into the cognate problem why the dreamthoughts also experience distortion by the censor when they abandon theprogressive continuation to consciousness and choose the path ofregression. I have been above all anxious to awaken an interest in theproblems to which the further analysis of the dreamwork leads and toindicate the other themes which meet these on the way. It was not alwayseasy to decide just where the pursuit should be discontinued. That Ihave not treated exhaustively the part played in the dream by thepsychosexual life and have avoided the interpretation of dreams of anobvious sexual content is due to a special reason which may not come upto the reader\\'s expectation. To be sure, it is very far from my ideasand the principles expressed by me in neuropathology to regard thesexual life as a \"pudendum\" which should be left unconsidered by thephysician and the scientific investigator. I also consider ludicrous themoral indignation which prompted the translator of Artemidoros of Daldisto keep from the reader\\'s knowledge the chapter on sexual dreamscontained in the _Symbolism of the Dreams_. As for myself, I have beenactuated solely by the conviction that in the explanation of sexualdreams I should be bound to entangle myself deeply in the stillunexplained problems of perversion and bisexuality; and for that reasonI have reserved this material for another connection.IXTHE UNCONSCIOUS AND CONSCIOUSNESS--REALITYOn closer inspection we find that it is not the existence of two systemsnear the motor end of the apparatus but of two kinds of processes ormodes of emotional discharge, the assumption of which was explained inthe psychological discussions of the previous chapter. This can make nodifference for us, for we must always be ready to drop our auxiliaryideas whenever we deem ourselves in position to replace them bysomething else approaching more closely to the unknown reality. Let usnow try to correct some views which might be erroneously formed as longas we regarded the two systems in the crudest and most obvious sense astwo localities within the psychic apparatus, views which have left theirtraces in the terms \"repression\" and \"penetration.\" Thus, when we saythat an unconscious idea strives for transference into the foreconsciousin order later to penetrate consciousness, we do not mean that a secondidea is to be formed situated in a new locality like an interlineationnear which the original continues to remain; also, when we speak ofpenetration into consciousness, we wish carefully to avoid any idea ofchange of locality. When we say that a foreconscious idea is repressedand subsequently taken up by the unconscious, we might be tempted bythese figures, borrowed from the idea of a struggle over a territory, toassume that an arrangement is really broken up in one psychic localityand replaced by a new one in the other locality. For these comparisonswe substitute what would seem to correspond better with the real stateof affairs by saying that an energy occupation is displaced to orwithdrawn from a certain arrangement so that the psychic formation fallsunder the domination of a system or is withdrawn from the same. Hereagain we replace a topical mode of presentation by a dynamic; it is notthe psychic formation that appears to us as the moving factor but theinnervation of the same.I deem it appropriate and justifiable, however, to apply ourselves stillfurther to the illustrative conception of the two systems. We shallavoid any misapplication of this manner of representation if we rememberthat presentations, thoughts, and psychic formations should generallynot be localized in the organic elements of the nervous system, but, soto speak, between them, where resistances and paths form the correlatecorresponding to them. Everything that can become an object of ourinternal perception is virtual, like the image in the telescope producedby the passage of the rays of light. But we are justified in assumingthe existence of the systems, which have nothing psychic in themselvesand which never become accessible to our psychic perception,corresponding to the lenses of the telescope which design the image. Ifwe continue this comparison, we may say that the censor between twosystems corresponds to the refraction of rays during their passage intoa new medium.Thus far we have made psychology on our own responsibility; it is nowtime to examine the theoretical opinions governing present-daypsychology and to test their relation to our theories. The question ofthe unconscious, in psychology is, according to the authoritative wordsof Lipps, less a psychological question than the question of psychology.As long as psychology settled this question with the verbal explanationthat the \"psychic\" is the \"conscious\" and that \"unconscious psychicoccurrences\" are an obvious contradiction, a psychological estimate ofthe observations gained by the physician from abnormal mental states wasprecluded. The physician and the philosopher agree only when bothacknowledge that unconscious psychic processes are \"the appropriate andwell-justified expression for an established fact.\" The physician cannotbut reject with a shrug of his shoulders the assertion that\"consciousness is the indispensable quality of the psychic\"; he mayassume, if his respect for the utterings of the philosophers still bestrong enough, that he and they do not treat the same subject and do notpursue the same science. For a single intelligent observation of thepsychic life of a neurotic, a single analysis of a dream must force uponhim the unalterable conviction that the most complicated and correctmental operations, to which no one will refuse the name of psychicoccurrences, may take place without exciting the consciousness of theperson. It is true that the physician does not learn of theseunconscious processes until they have exerted such an effect onconsciousness as to admit communication or observation. But this effectof consciousness may show a psychic character widely differing from theunconscious process, so that the internal perception cannot possiblyrecognize the one as a substitute for the other. The physician mustreserve for himself the right to penetrate, by a process of deduction,from the effect on consciousness to the unconscious psychic process; helearns in this way that the effect on consciousness is only a remotepsychic product of the unconscious process and that the latter has notbecome conscious as such; that it has been in existence and operativewithout betraying itself in any way to consciousness.A reaction from the over-estimation of the quality of consciousnessbecomes the indispensable preliminary condition for any correct insightinto the behavior of the psychic. In the words of Lipps, the unconsciousmust be accepted as the general basis of the psychic life. Theunconscious is the larger circle which includes within itself thesmaller circle of the conscious; everything conscious has itspreliminary step in the unconscious, whereas the unconscious may stopwith this step and still claim full value as a psychic activity.Properly speaking, the unconscious is the real psychic; _its innernature is just as unknown to us as the reality of the external world,and it is just as imperfectly reported to us through the data ofconsciousness as is the external world through the indications of oursensory organs_.A series of dream problems which have intensely occupied older authorswill be laid aside when the old opposition between conscious life anddream life is abandoned and the unconscious psychic assigned to itsproper place. Thus many of the activities whose performances in thedream have excited our admiration are now no longer to be attributed tothe dream but to unconscious thinking, which is also active during theday. If, according to Scherner, the dream seems to play with a symbolingrepresentation of the body, we know that this is the work of certainunconscious phantasies which have probably given in to sexual emotions,and that these phantasies come to expression not only in dreams but alsoin hysterical phobias and in other symptoms. If the dream continues andsettles activities of the day and even brings to light valuableinspirations, we have only to subtract from it the dream disguise as afeat of dream-work and a mark of assistance from obscure forces in thedepth of the mind (_cf._ the devil in Tartini\\'s sonata dream). Theintellectual task as such must be attributed to the same psychic forceswhich perform all such tasks during the day. We are probably far toomuch inclined to over-estimate the conscious character even ofintellectual and artistic productions. From the communications of someof the most highly productive persons, such as Goethe and Helmholtz, welearn, indeed, that the most essential and original parts in theircreations came to them in the form of inspirations and reached theirperceptions almost finished. There is nothing strange about theassistance of the conscious activity in other cases where there was aconcerted effort of all the psychic forces. But it is a much abusedprivilege of the conscious activity that it is allowed to hide from usall other activities wherever it participates.It will hardly be worth while to take up the historical significance ofdreams as a special subject. Where, for instance, a chieftain has beenurged through a dream to engage in a bold undertaking the success ofwhich has had the effect of changing history, a new problem results onlyso long as the dream, regarded as a strange power, is contrasted withother more familiar psychic forces; the problem, however, disappearswhen we regard the dream as a form of expression for feelings which areburdened with resistance during the day and which can receivereinforcements at night from deep emotional sources. But the greatrespect shown by the ancients for the dream is based on a correctpsychological surmise. It is a homage paid to the unsubdued andindestructible in the human mind, and to the demoniacal which furnishesthe dream-wish and which we find again in our unconscious.Not inadvisedly do I use the expression \"in our unconscious,\" for whatwe so designate does not coincide with the unconscious of thephilosophers, nor with the unconscious of Lipps. In the latter uses itis intended to designate only the opposite of conscious. That there arealso unconscious psychic processes beside the conscious ones is thehotly contested and energetically defended issue. Lipps gives us themore far-reaching theory that everything psychic exists as unconscious,but that some of it may exist also as conscious. But it was not to provethis theory that we have adduced the phenomena of the dream and of thehysterical symptom formation; the observation of normal life alonesuffices to establish its correctness beyond any doubt. The new factthat we have learned from the analysis of the psychopathologicalformations, and indeed from their first member, viz. dreams, is that theunconscious--hence the psychic--occurs as a function of two separatesystems and that it occurs as such even in normal psychic life.Consequently there are two kinds of unconscious, which we do not as yetfind distinguished by the psychologists. Both are unconscious in thepsychological sense; but in our sense the first, which we call Unc., islikewise incapable of consciousness, whereas the second we term \"Forec.\"because its emotions, after the observance of certain rules, can reachconsciousness, perhaps not before they have again undergone censorship,but still regardless of the Unc. system. The fact that in order toattain consciousness the emotions must traverse an unalterable series ofevents or succession of instances, as is betrayed through theiralteration by the censor, has helped us to draw a comparison fromspatiality. We described the relations of the two systems to each otherand to consciousness by saying that the system Forec. is like a screenbetween the system Unc. and consciousness. The system Forec. not onlybars access to consciousness, but also controls the entrance tovoluntary motility and is capable of sending out a sum of mobile energy,a portion of which is familiar to us as attention.We must also steer clear of the distinctions superconscious andsubconscious which have found so much favor in the more recentliterature on the psychoneuroses, for just such a distinction seems toemphasize the equivalence of the psychic and the conscious.What part now remains in our description of the once all-powerful andall-overshadowing consciousness? None other than that of a sensory organfor the perception of psychic qualities. According to the fundamentalidea of schematic undertaking we can conceive the conscious perceptiononly as the particular activity of an independent system for which theabbreviated designation \"Cons.\" commends itself. This system we conceiveto be similar in its mechanical characteristics to the perception systemP, hence excitable by qualities and incapable of retaining the trace ofchanges, _i.e._ it is devoid of memory. The psychic apparatus which,with the sensory organs of the P-system, is turned to the outer world,is itself the outer world for the sensory organ of Cons.; theteleological justification of which rests on this relationship. We arehere once more confronted with the principle of the succession ofinstances which seems to dominate the structure of the apparatus. Thematerial under excitement flows to the Cons, sensory organ from twosides, firstly from the P-system whose excitement, qualitativelydetermined, probably experiences a new elaboration until it comes toconscious perception; and, secondly, from the interior of the apparatusitself, the quantitative processes of which are perceived as aqualitative series of pleasure and pain as soon as they have undergonecertain changes.The philosophers, who have learned that correct and highly complicatedthought structures are possible even without the coÃ¶peration ofconsciousness, have found it difficult to attribute any function toconsciousness; it has appeared to them a superfluous mirroring of theperfected psychic process. The analogy of our Cons. system with thesystems of perception relieves us of this embarrassment. We see thatperception through our sensory organs results in directing theoccupation of attention to those paths on which the incoming sensoryexcitement is diffused; the qualitative excitement of the P-systemserves the mobile quantity of the psychic apparatus as a regulator forits discharge. We may claim the same function for the overlying sensoryorgan of the Cons. system. By assuming new qualities, it furnishes a newcontribution toward the guidance and suitable distribution of the mobileoccupation quantities. By means of the perceptions of pleasure and pain,it influences the course of the occupations within the psychicapparatus, which normally operates unconsciously and through thedisplacement of quantities. It is probable that the principle of painfirst regulates the displacements of occupation automatically, but it isquite possible that the consciousness of these qualities adds a secondand more subtle regulation which may even oppose the first and perfectthe working capacity of the apparatus by placing it in a positioncontrary to its original design for occupying and developing even thatwhich is connected with the liberation of pain. We learn fromneuropsychology that an important part in the functional activity of theapparatus is attributed to such regulations through the qualitativeexcitation of the sensory organs. The automatic control of the primaryprinciple of pain and the restriction of mental capacity connected withit are broken by the sensible regulations, which in their turn are againautomatisms. We learn that the repression which, though originallyexpedient, terminates nevertheless in a harmful rejection of inhibitionand of psychic domination, is so much more easily accomplished withreminiscences than with perceptions, because in the former there is noincrease in occupation through the excitement of the psychic sensoryorgans. When an idea to be rejected has once failed to become consciousbecause it has succumbed to repression, it can be repressed on otheroccasions only because it has been withdrawn from conscious perceptionon other grounds. These are hints employed by therapy in order to bringabout a retrogression of accomplished repressions.The value of the over-occupation which is produced by the regulatinginfluence of the Cons. sensory organ on the mobile quantity, isdemonstrated in the teleological connection by nothing more clearly thanby the creation of a new series of qualities and consequently a newregulation which constitutes the precedence of man over the animals. Forthe mental processes are in themselves devoid of quality except for theexcitements of pleasure and pain accompanying them, which, as we know,are to be held in check as possible disturbances of thought. In order toendow them with a quality, they are associated in man with verbalmemories, the qualitative remnants of which suffice to draw upon themthe attention of consciousness which in turn endows thought with a newmobile energy.The manifold problems of consciousness in their entirety can be examinedonly through an analysis of the hysterical mental process. From thisanalysis we receive the impression that the transition from theforeconscious to the occupation of consciousness is also connected witha censorship similar to the one between the Unc. and the Forec. Thiscensorship, too, begins to act only with the reaching of a certainquantitative degree, so that few intense thought formations escape it.Every possible case of detention from consciousness, as well as ofpenetration to consciousness, under restriction is found included withinthe picture of the psychoneurotic phenomena; every case points to theintimate and twofold connection between the censor and consciousness. Ishall conclude these psychological discussions with the report of twosuch occurrences.On the occasion of a consultation a few years ago the subject was anintelligent and innocent-looking girl. Her attire was strange; whereas awoman\\'s garb is usually groomed to the last fold, she had one of herstockings hanging down and two of her waist buttons opened. Shecomplained of pains in one of her legs, and exposed her leg unrequested.Her chief complaint, however, was in her own words as follows: She had afeeling in her body as if something was stuck into it which moved to andfro and made her tremble through and through. This sometimes made herwhole body stiff. On hearing this, my colleague in consultation lookedat me; the complaint was quite plain to him. To both of us it seemedpeculiar that the patient\\'s mother thought nothing of the matter; ofcourse she herself must have been repeatedly in the situation describedby her child. As for the girl, she had no idea of the import of herwords or she would never have allowed them to pass her lips. Here thecensor had been deceived so successfully that under the mask of aninnocent complaint a phantasy was admitted to consciousness whichotherwise would have remained in the foreconscious.Another example: I began the psychoanalytic treatment of a boy offourteen years who was suffering from _tic convulsif_, hystericalvomiting, headache, &c., by assuring him that, after closing his eyes,he would see pictures or have ideas, which I requested him tocommunicate to me. He answered by describing pictures. The lastimpression he had received before coming to me was visually revived inhis memory. He had played a game of checkers with his uncle, and now sawthe checkerboard before him. He commented on various positions that werefavorable or unfavorable, on moves that were not safe to make. He thensaw a dagger lying on the checker-board, an object belonging to hisfather, but transferred to the checker-board by his phantasy. Then asickle was lying on the board; next a scythe was added; and, finally, hebeheld the likeness of an old peasant mowing the grass in front of theboy\\'s distant parental home. A few days later I discovered the meaningof this series of pictures. Disagreeable family relations had made theboy nervous. It was the case of a strict and crabbed father who livedunhappily with his mother, and whose educational methods consisted inthreats; of the separation of his father from his tender and delicatemother, and the remarrying of his father, who one day brought home ayoung woman as his new mamma. The illness of the fourteen-year-old boybroke out a few days later. It was the suppressed anger against hisfather that had composed these pictures into intelligible allusions. Thematerial was furnished by a reminiscence from mythology, The sickle wasthe one with which Zeus castrated his father; the scythe and thelikeness of the peasant represented Kronos, the violent old man who eatshis children and upon whom Zeus wreaks vengeance in so unfilial amanner. The marriage of the father gave the boy an opportunity to returnthe reproaches and threats of his father--which had previously been madebecause the child played with his genitals (the checkerboard; theprohibitive moves; the dagger with which a person may be killed). Wehave here long repressed memories and their unconscious remnants which,under the guise of senseless pictures have slipped into consciousness bydevious paths left open to them.I should then expect to find the theoretical value of the study ofdreams in its contribution to psychological knowledge and in itspreparation for an understanding of neuroses. Who can foresee theimportance of a thorough knowledge of the structure and activities ofthe psychic apparatus when even our present state of knowledge producesa happy therapeutic influence in the curable forms of thepsychoneuroses? What about the practical value of such study some onemay ask, for psychic knowledge and for the discovering of the secretpeculiarities of individual character? Have not the unconscious feelingsrevealed by the dream the value of real forces in the psychic life?Should we take lightly the ethical significance of the suppressed wisheswhich, as they now create dreams, may some day create other things?I do not feel justified in answering these questions. I have not thoughtfurther upon this side of the dream problem. I believe, however, that atall events the Roman Emperor was in the wrong who ordered one of hissubjects executed because the latter dreamt that he had killed theEmperor. He should first have endeavored to discover the significance ofthe dream; most probably it was not what it seemed to be. And even if adream of different content had the significance of this offense againstmajesty, it would still have been in place to remember the words ofPlato, that the virtuous man contents himself with dreaming that whichthe wicked man does in actual life. I am therefore of the opinion thatit is best to accord freedom to dreams. Whether any reality is to beattributed to the unconscious wishes, and in what sense, I am notprepared to say offhand. Reality must naturally be denied to alltransition--and intermediate thoughts. If we had before us theunconscious wishes, brought to their last and truest expression, weshould still do well to remember that more than one single form ofexistence must be ascribed to the psychic reality. Action and theconscious expression of thought mostly suffice for the practical needof judging a man\\'s character. Action, above all, merits to be placed inthe first rank; for many of the impulses penetrating consciousness areneutralized by real forces of the psychic life before they are convertedinto action; indeed, the reason why they frequently do not encounter anypsychic obstacle on their way is because the unconscious is certain oftheir meeting with resistances later. In any case it is instructive tobecome familiar with the much raked-up soil from which our virtuesproudly arise. For the complication of human character movingdynamically in all directions very rarely accommodates itself toadjustment through a simple alternative, as our antiquated moralphilosophy would have it.And how about the value of the dream for a knowledge of the future?That, of course, we cannot consider. One feels inclined to substitute:\"for a knowledge of the past.\" For the dream originates from the past inevery sense. To be sure the ancient belief that the dream reveals thefuture is not entirely devoid of truth. By representing to us a wish asfulfilled the dream certainly leads us into the future; but this future,taken by the dreamer as present, has been formed into the likeness ofthat past by the indestructible wish.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Dream Psychology, by Sigmund Freud*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DREAM PSYCHOLOGY ******** This file should be named 15489-8.txt or 15489-8.zip *****This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.net/1/5/4/8/15489/Produced by David Newman, Joel Schlosberg and the Online DistributedProofreading Team.Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project GutenbergLiterary Archive FoundationProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission ofincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can befreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widestarray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exemptstatus with the IRS.The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulatingcharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the UnitedStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes aconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep upwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locationswhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  ToSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for anyparticular state visit http://pglaf.orgWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where wehave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibitionagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states whoapproach us with offers to donate.International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot makeany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received fromoutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donationmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of otherways including including checks, online payments and credit carddonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donateSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronicworks.Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tmconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely sharedwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed ProjectGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarilykeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:     http://www.gutenberg.netThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how tosubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.'"
